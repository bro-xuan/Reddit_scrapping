Westman Island. Do you recommend day trip or ferry the car and stay a night on Westman Island?

Any other puffin sites good for photography?

This is the place where you can photograph them in very close proximity. There are plenty of them. Some are so near that you can even touch them (although you absolutely should not!). You don't need to drive through any F-roads to get there.

Over a year ago my sister and her family traveled to Iceland and had an amazing time. My youngest nephew became enamored with a particular souvenir, a puffin plushie with a stereotypical Viking helmet. He was unable to buy the item because they did not want to haul it around and find a place in their luggage for it. He continues to talk about this toy to this day. Can anyone direct me to a store website that sells these Viking puffins? I would be ever so grateful!",7,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1eqyh66/a_quest_for_a_viking_puffin/
Post,1e8xs3s,Westman Islands Puffin,snizo_,2024-07-21 21:58:24,"Hi all! I'm visiting Iceland in August and interested in visiting the Westman Islands, primarily for the puffins. I work in avian conservation and I've heard about the nightly ""Puffin Patrol"" to help get the pufflings out to sea. Is it frowned upon for foreigners/tourists to participate in this?? I can think of no better way to spend my vacation than helping the pufflings on their way but also want to be respectful to the locals! 
",4,7.0,https://reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1e8xs3s/westman_islands_puffin/
Comment,1e8xs3s,,snizo_,2024-08-19 00:50:53,"I ended up changing my trip to September due to work so all I can tell you is what I've learned from reading care guides! 

1) Puffin Patrol isnt really a gathering of volunteers per se, you just kind of go out on your own at night. Pufflings get confused by artificial light, so in the city or by the harbor are probably your best bets. They can also be found not far from colonies, such as near Heimaklettur, Ei√∞i√∞, and Dalfjall. 

2) Pufflings generally fledge (leave the nest) at the very end of August or early September. Puffling season typically ends ~4 weeks later. August 19th is probably slightly too early to see any pufflings, but you could try calling the Sea Life Trust and asking if they've had any puffling reports yet.  

3) Catching a Puffling:

-After dark, use a flashlight to check under cars, boxes, alleys, etc. for pufflings. Be very careful not to step on a puffling when chasing it! Use clean gloves when catching a puffling. Any standard pair should do, doesn't have to be medical gloves. Puffins are seabirds so they rely on a special oil coating on their feathers to remain waterproof. The oils on human hands can disrupt feather waterproofing if handled too much. Hold the bird with its wings pressed against its sides to prevent any injuries from flapping/wiggling. 

-After catching the puffling, place it in a cardboard box. You can also place grass at the bottom to help avoid pufflings from getting their own feces on them. This is a very stressful experience for them so keeping them in a dark, safe environment helps calm the bird. Be sure to use a box with proper airflow, but not holes big enough for the bird to escape or injure itself. Most local hotels and businesses can give you a box or assist you in finding one. Avoid handling the bird once it is in the box - remember these are wild animals that need rescuing and too much human interaction can be harmful! 

-DO NOT feed the bird. Oils from fish placed in the box can harm the feathers. 

-Ideally only keep 1 bird per box. 


4) Releasing a Puffling:

-Pufflings MUST be released the next morning. If your puffling seems injured, lethargic, or underweight (underweight birds have a very prominent and pointy breastbone rather than a rounded one) please take it to the Sea Life Trust where a rehab team can give it medical attention! You can also bring your healthy bird to the Sea Life Trust in the morning to get it checked out & weighed for researcher data. 

-If your bird is healthy you can go release it! DO NOT release it in the harbor, as oils from ships can damage the feathers. Popular release spots include cliffs, beaches, or boats out at sea away from human activity. 

-When releasing the bird, hold it firmly around the midsection but do not cover the wings. Toss your arms up gently one or two times before releasing the bird to allow it to feel the wind and prepare for flight. Toss your bird into the air over the water. At this point, many pufflings WILL NOT fly - that is okay! Often pufflings will sit on the water for a second or two before diving below. Whether your puffling flys or dives is perfectly fine. 

5) Remember that Puffin Patrol is a rescue effort! Pufflings are not pets and should be handled, treated, and respected as wild animals. As exciting as it is to see a puffling, please act safely and responsibly when on patrol. 

Hope this helps!",5,,https://reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1e8xs3s/westman_islands_puffin/

It sounds like the northern locations like Grimsey would be more likely to have early arrivals than southern locations like the Westman Islands.  I have read that this is due to sand lances (a.k.a. sand eels) migrating northwards to seek colder waters as climate change warms the ocean.  

Heading to Grimsey would take up most of our time in Iceland and it sounds like the Westfjords are difficult to navigate in April. Would Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur Eystri be our best bet?",2,,https://reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1axsl7f/puffin_arrival_alerts/

If this is the correct spot where would the nearest appropriate parking be before making the walk to the cliffs and is this area accessible during early august? I've heard that possibly it gets closed because of the nesting.

There seems to be a road on maps directly to the lighthouse but street view shows it gated off and there isn't a clear parking area on the satellite image.

Comment,12agkzv,,Fywe,2023-04-03 11:24:51,"Poor crash landing puffin!

That being said, I'm going to hijack your post in case someone wants to photograph our birbs this spring/summer: please **please do not fly drones anywhere near their nests.** (Looks like OP used a camera/phone, so I'm not bashing you!)

The parents are very protective of their eggs/chicks. Drones are *scary* for a bird. I've witnessed a seagull attack a drone, before we managed to get to the owner and ask them to move the drone away. The seagull won (yeah, we cheered), but it could have gotten hurt and thus leaving its eggs/chicks without a parent. It might also scare them off the nest long enough for the eggs to cool down and die. We don't want that.

Don't be idiots, be respectful of the wildlife.

We were there a day ago, there were some puffins, super adorable as well we've seen some belugas. The whole thing is not like super interactive, but I feel it's a good thing, they're there not to entertain. So in general it was cool to support the sanctuary as it seems that they have a good cause (they share their story there which is neat). 
So all in all it was good for us, puffins are clumsy and cute to see, especially when it is not possible to see them on the coast  (but if you'll go there, there's also one bigger bird with the puffins, he swims like crazy, blew me away :D)",5,,https://reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/xm9iuz/hi_we_have_an_open_day_and_i_wondered_if_anyone/
