Post,Puffins in late April,LtheDutch,2025-02-08 01:44:00,"I'm hoping to come to Iceland this April with my teen daughter, on a 2-3 day layover flight. She really wants to see puffins. This page has been very helpful with research and planning - and it sounds like puffins will probably be back in Iceland by the time of our visit. 
All the tours that I'm finding online start taking reservations for May 1st - does anyone know if it's possible to book a puffin tour before that, and which tour operator might be the best to talk to about that ?

 For reference, we will hopefully be there April 22-24.",4,4.0
Comment,,PolarBearEnt,2025-02-08 06:48:47,"Puffin season is generally from early May to end of August. You could do a Whale Watching tour from Reykjavik with a RIB boat, they'll most likely pass by the puffin island, and if the puffins have arrived early then you may see them. I'd recommend the tour with Elding.is, called premium whale watching from Reykjavik. 

A guaranteed way to see puffins would be to do a day trip to the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar), and go to the beluga whale and puffin sanctuary.

Comment,,Just-Replacement8284,2025-02-08 01:53:31,"It's not likely at all that there will be either tours or puffins at that time.  Tour operate by giving the customers what they are paying for and the little critters are still thinking about their trip to Iceland at this time of year... 

Best time is June-August...",1,
Comment,,goodie1663,2025-02-08 16:46:52,"My guess is that most of the operators do those dates because they can pretty much count on having puffins then, and it's not worth offering dates where they have to cancel. 

I was there the third week in August, and the tour operator had to cancel all tours on the day I booked because of bad weather. When they called me, they suggested doing the first tour of the day the next day because generally the weather was better then, so that's what I did. 

I very much enjoyed it, but we only saw maybe twenty total or so. The guide said that they were going to cancel all tours after that day and give refunds because the puffins had clearly decided that it was time to leave. 

I did see more of them later in several other locations, but you truly never know. Weather is also a factor.",1,

Comment,,moomeecee,2025-01-28 16:30:51,"We saw SO MANY puffins on Westman island on 8/8/24.

Comment,,TheScarletFox,2025-01-28 16:40:46,I went to Iceland in late August of 2023 and I saw a ton of puffins in Heimaey in the Westman Islands. Definitely consider going there at least as a day trip if you have time. The island was our favorite part of our trip.,2,

Comment,,Perenially_behind,2025-01-28 17:47:47,"We saw some on the hills above Reynisfjara beach in mid-August last year (Aug 16, which is about as mid as you can get). We were told there had been more a couple of weeks earlier. But there were enough to enjoy. 

In Washington State we have rhinoceros auklets, which are closely related to puffins and behave similarly. We generally see them on open water. But they don't have those colorful bill sheaths.

Comment,,goodie1663,2025-01-28 18:02:05,"I was there the third week of August 2024, and I saw puffins, both on a puffin tour out of the capital and later at the infamous black sand beach with the ""sneaker waves"" (Reynisfjara).

Comment,,Skyhawk_Everheart,2025-01-05 16:44:29,"Considering they're not classified as endangered, yeah I don't feel bad. At all. They've also been part of the Icelandic diet for centuries.

I trust the Icelandic government entirely to regulate the hunting of puffins to maintain a healthy population, which they do. 

Congrats on not making me feel bad. I also want to thank you - I did a touch of extra research on this topic thanks to your comment. That research has encouraged me to plan on ordering a second helping of puffin if I like it enough the first time.

Cheers!",1,

Post,Vestmannaeyjar or Reykjavik boat cruise for puffins with 6-year-old kids?,SadlyNotSpaceballs,2024-12-16 20:24:50,"Hi, I'm coming back to a third visit to Iceland in June for a quick stopover trip, bringing my kids (6-year-old boys) for the first time. We only have 3 days. I'm debating whether it's worth dedicated a full day to Vestmannaeyjar vs. doing the short boat cruise for whales and puffins out of Reykjavik. Here's my (very tentative) agenda:

Wednesday: Arrive in late afternoon from Copenhagen. Rest and explore downtown Reykjavik. Shopping, dinner. Lava Show at night. Grab a hot dog.

Thursday: Golden Circle. Add Bruarfoss. Tomato restaurant maybe for lunch. Raufarhólshellir. Dinner.

Friday: Puffins. Here's my debate - do a full-day trip, or what I'm leaning to is doing the boat tour which would open things up for Perlan, FlyOver, Nexus, maybe Secret Lagoon. Anything else I'm missing that kids would love?

Saturday: Kids' 6th birthday! Anything special to do in morning other than cinnamon buns from Broadco? Fly home in late afternoon.

Planning to go to Borgarfjörður Eystri. This does not travel through F road right? Planning to stay there one night.

Westman Island. Do you recommend day trip or ferry the car and stay a night on Westman Island?

Any other puffin sites good for photography?

I've read for some sites (Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg?), puffins are on a cliff and quite far, so thinking not ideal for photography.

Comment,,puffin-net,2024-12-02 20:30:07,Reynisfjara (one of the black sand beaches on the south coast) has puffins nesting above the basalt columns.

Comment,,hertziceland,2024-12-03 09:15:50,"You're right about Borgarfjörður Eystri; it’s a great choice and doesn’t involve F roads, so you’ll have a smooth drive. Staying overnight is a good idea to catch those early morning and late evening shots when the light is just perfect.

For the Westman Islands, if you can spare the time, I'd recommend staying the night rather than just doing a day trip. It gives you more flexibility to explore and photograph the puffins and the stunning landscapes there without rushing. Plus, the sunset and sunrise are spectacular!

You mentioned Dyrhólaey and Látrabjarg; indeed, puffins can be a bit far on the cliffs which might challenge photography without a good zoom lens. If you're looking for other sites where the puffins might be easier to photograph, consider places like Akurey, Stórhöfði in Vestmannaeyjar, and Tjörnes Peninsula near Húsavík for some fantastic opportunities.

Some of the locations will even include the precise gps coordinates. This is what it shows currently for last 3 days.

Comment,,snizo_,2024-08-19 00:50:53,"I ended up changing my trip to September due to work so all I can tell you is what I've learned from reading care guides! 

1) Puffin Patrol isnt really a gathering of volunteers per se, you just kind of go out on your own at night. Pufflings get confused by artificial light, so in the city or by the harbor are probably your best bets. They can also be found not far from colonies, such as near Heimaklettur, Eiðið, and Dalfjall. 

2) Pufflings generally fledge (leave the nest) at the very end of August or early September. Puffling season typically ends ~4 weeks later. August 19th is probably slightly too early to see any pufflings, but you could try calling the Sea Life Trust and asking if they've had any puffling reports yet.  

3) Catching a Puffling:

-After dark, use a flashlight to check under cars, boxes, alleys, etc. for pufflings. Be very careful not to step on a puffling when chasing it! Use clean gloves when catching a puffling. Any standard pair should do, doesn't have to be medical gloves. Puffins are seabirds so they rely on a special oil coating on their feathers to remain waterproof. The oils on human hands can disrupt feather waterproofing if handled too much. Hold the bird with its wings pressed against its sides to prevent any injuries from flapping/wiggling. 

-After catching the puffling, place it in a cardboard box. You can also place grass at the bottom to help avoid pufflings from getting their own feces on them. This is a very stressful experience for them so keeping them in a dark, safe environment helps calm the bird. Be sure to use a box with proper airflow, but not holes big enough for the bird to escape or injure itself. Most local hotels and businesses can give you a box or assist you in finding one. Avoid handling the bird once it is in the box - remember these are wild animals that need rescuing and too much human interaction can be harmful! 

-DO NOT feed the bird. Oils from fish placed in the box can harm the feathers. 

-Ideally only keep 1 bird per box. 


4) Releasing a Puffling:

-Pufflings MUST be released the next morning. If your puffling seems injured, lethargic, or underweight (underweight birds have a very prominent and pointy breastbone rather than a rounded one) please take it to the Sea Life Trust where a rehab team can give it medical attention! You can also bring your healthy bird to the Sea Life Trust in the morning to get it checked out & weighed for researcher data. 

-If your bird is healthy you can go release it! DO NOT release it in the harbor, as oils from ships can damage the feathers. Popular release spots include cliffs, beaches, or boats out at sea away from human activity. 

-When releasing the bird, hold it firmly around the midsection but do not cover the wings. Toss your arms up gently one or two times before releasing the bird to allow it to feel the wind and prepare for flight. Toss your bird into the air over the water. At this point, many pufflings WILL NOT fly - that is okay! Often pufflings will sit on the water for a second or two before diving below. Whether your puffling flys or dives is perfectly fine. 

5) Remember that Puffin Patrol is a rescue effort! Pufflings are not pets and should be handled, treated, and respected as wild animals. As exciting as it is to see a puffling, please act safely and responsibly when on patrol. 

Hope this helps!",4,

Comment,,snizo_,2024-12-11 16:04:27,"

If you go in May you'll see adult puffins - if you go in September you MIGHT see pufflings. If your primary goal is to see puffins I'd probably go in May. 

In September the adult puffins have all gone out to sea and most of the pufflings are gone too. I ended up seeing one puffling by the Westman Islands harbor on September 14th around 10:15pm, but that was very unexpected. No one was out doing puffin patrol except us, and we got worried that we looked sketchy so finished by 11:30 or so. My understanding is that tourists are welcome to join in puffling patrol so long as you're being respectful (see my guide below), but if you're visiting specifically for puffling patrol I'd plan to go during late August or during the very first few days of September when everyone else is out.",1,

While you’re there, I really recommend Puffin Adventures (puffin.is). It’s run by 2 brothers who are super knowledgeable about the geography, wildlife, and culture of the area (they live in the village and were fishermen before starting their business). The rest of the pictures are from our tour but the pictures don’t do it justice. It was the high point of an already phenomenal trip. It’s a little RIB so you feel like you are flying with the puffins and other sea birds when on the ocean and you get to go into all these hidden coves along the coast. We also saw seals and the day before they saw whales, so it is more than just a puffin trip.

Comment,,Adamantium-Aardvark,2024-06-27 12:29:00,"- Dyrholaey is accessible by car on the south coast. 

- Heimaey is an island and requires a ferry. 

- Ingolfshöfði requires a tour with a tractor ride across a large beach and a hike up onto an island. Pricey but people seem to enjoy it. 


The cool thing about Borgarfjarðarhöfn is that you can just drive right up to the harbor, and walk up a short staircase and see the puffins right up close at no extra cost. The only “cost” is the long drive there. It makes sense if you’re doing the ring road and stopping in Egisslatdir, since it’s only an hour drive from there. But I wouldn’t do a 5 hour drive each way just to go to this spot, personally.",3,
Comment,,MinervasOwlAtDusk,2024-06-27 13:44:56,"Heimaey is part of the Westman Islands. It’s about a 2-2.5 hour ferry trip from Reykjavik, then a 10 minute drive (if you have a car) to the point with all the puffins. There’s a terrific volcano museum there, too. This option is cheaper, but if you don’t have a car, it’s about a 30 minute hike to the puffins (which is fine, except it’s often in cold rain, so be sure to have rain gear).

Another option—there are puffin boat tours that leave from Reykjavik. This would be somewhat more expensive.",2,
Comment,,Trivial-P-Happiness,2024-06-27 19:25:01,"Borgarfjörður eystri was heaven for me, but that is a long trek and you should try to going the morning or evening.

We were at the puffin lookout on the westman islands around 8pm and only saw a couple. A few hours late we saw tons coming back to nest elsewhere on the island. And Dyrhólaey closes at 7pm. You should be able to see some at Reynisfjara Beach because you can go later in the evening. As already mentioned, the Ingólfshöfði Puffin tour is another option closer to you.",1,

It’s a 1 hour drive from Egilsstaðir in the Eastern part of the country. It’s free to go. There’s no tours or even any parking fee.

Comment,,stevenarwhals,2024-06-20 17:51:56,"Borgarfjordur Eystri (aka Bakkagerdi) is the best place to reliably see lots of the but but be aware it's all the way out at the end of the Eastfjords. You would have to dedicate your whole trip to doing the south coast and back to see them there with the number of days you have. That's a fine way to do a trip, especially if puffins are your top priority, but just wanted to make sure you're aware. It's not like it's a day trip or even really a 2-day trip from Reykjavik or anything. The next best spot is probably Latrabjarg in the Westfjords, which is similarly remote. Easier but less reliable places to see them include Dyrholaey and Vestmannaeyjar. There are also boat tours from Reykjavik that go out to some of the little skerries where the puffins hang out. By the end of August, however, it's really up to luck how many are still around in any given place. Some years they hang out longer than others; all depends on the weather, local food supply, etc.",3,
Comment,,NoLemon5426,2024-06-20 13:51:54,"There will still be puffins in Heimaey. Depending on how the season goes, it might be possible for you to help catch baby puffins (pufflings), babysit them overnight, and then launch them off of cliffs in the morning. Does this sound fun?

Comment,,letmebebrave430,2024-06-21 00:02:14,"Ooo I hope you can see them! They were honestly the highlight of my trip. You might also check some other puffin-spotting areas and do some research to see if they stay longer. I'm totally guessing here (no fact behind this) but they're quite social birds so maybe the colonies tend to fly off to sea around the same time? And maybe it's possible some colonies around the country fly off later than others?

Good luck though! Borgarfjörður Eystri is a great place to see them though...if they're there

Post,Puffins in Tjornes?,AbyssalScribe,2024-06-08 09:48:13,"Edit: I visited the location called Hringsbjarg on Google Maps, it's a cliff outlook in eastern Tjornes. There seems to be a dozen or two puffins in that area. It's easy to see them flying to the ocean and back to the cliffs. Seeing them nesting is a challenge. I walked up the trail going north and was able to spot two on the rocks. Obviously don't do a anything unsafe, it is an unprotected area (no fence, risk of slipping, edge collapse, wind gusts).

TLDR - Has anyone been to Tjornes very recently, and if so, is there a large puffin population active there now?

Hello! I'm currently in Akureyri, Iceland. My trip has been disrupted pretty badly by the snow and bad weather that has blown in. I'm doing my best to be adaptable and flexible and make the most of it. :)

The plan today was to go to Husavik for whale watching and then up to Tjornes where there's a puffin colony, however roads are bad, so I'm making a change and going to Dalvik instead. 

The weather and roads look like they might be better on Sunday, but I don't want to go all the way out to Tjornes if there isn't a view worth seeing. I'd like to see a lot of puffins, as in hundreds not a dozen.
