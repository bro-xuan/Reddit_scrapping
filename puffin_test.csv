Post,Is there room for the Westman Islands in this itinerary?,horseyhiker,2025-02-16 22:48:17,"Here is my mid-June high level itinerary.  I'm trying to decide if it's realistic to include the Westman Islands if we don't stay overnight.  I'll be with my 78yo Dad, so we won't be doing long hikes.  It sounds like we can see Puffins in Vik, so I don't want to go to Westman just to see them.  I really want to see Diamond Beach.

Day 1: arrive in KEF at 10pm

Day 2: start at Rey; drive Golden Circle; overnight in Selfoss

Day 3: drive to Vik; overnight in Vik

Day 4: drive to Hofn and back to Vik; overnight in Vik

Day 5: drive to Rey; overnight in Rey

Day 6: whale watching in Rey; drive to Blue Lagoon.  Overnight in KEF

Day 7: depart KEF at 10am",3,4.0
Comment,,jessica_wanders,2025-02-16 23:18:25,Day 2 or 5. Yes you can see puffins in Dyrhólaey but you can get closer to them on Heimaey. There’s also a beautiful small stave church. The beluga whale sanctuary is right in town and has a puffin rescue. Great view as you approach the islands. Worth a day trip if you have time.,3,
Comment,,TueegsKrambold,2025-02-16 23:02:02,"Do it on Day 5. Depending on your dad’s mobility, you can either leave your car and walk or take it. You really only need a couple of hours there if you’re not gonna do any hikes. Check the ferry schedule (note that many Icelandic calendars start on Saturday, not Sunday like in the US).",2,

Comment,,TueegsKrambold,2025-02-17 00:18:55,"It’s a pretty small island, and you can probably drive it in under an hour. You can also book a tour if hiking isn’t your thing.",1,
Post,Where to stay outside of Reykjavík with three year old in April?,La_Juche_Vita,2025-02-12 16:45:26,"TL;DR: Where should spouse, young kid and I stay outside of Reykjavik in late April? 

My spouse, kid (3yo) and I are going to Iceland at the end of April. We’ll be there for 7 days and plan on spending about half in Reykjavik and half somewhere else, and renting a car for the duration. My main two questions are: 

A) What will we need in a vehicle? (Size, 4WD, AWD, 2WD, etc.). Driving in icy/snowy conditions with a compact 2WD and snow tires is common where we’re from, but we don’t want to assume the conditions will be similar.

B) Where should we stay for our outside of Reykjavik portion, given the time of year and our interests? General area, specific town, or accommodations recommendations all appreciated.

Our interests (in approximate order of priority), and sub-questions:

1. **Puffins:** The kid loves puffins and it would mean a lot to see some in real life. I noticed most of the boat tours don’t start until the first week of May, and don’t let kids under 5 or so on board anyways. Are there any places you can (likely) see them from land at the end of April, or family friendly boat tours? Would be interested in other kinds of birdwatching as well.

2. **Unique geology/nature:** We all love hiking, and have a good rig for carrying the kid if necessary, but don’t want to be going anywhere too treacherous or that requires an all-day trek. We prefer DIYing it, but will splurge for a guided tour if necessary. What are accessible must-sees? Which part of the island is worth focusing on?

3. **Saltwater fishing:** Would be willing to hire a charter, but similar to puffin tours I’m mostly seeing this starting up in May—any charters that would operate at the end of April or is it dangerous? Failing that, any towns with piers/shorelines where people fish from land? Shore-targetable species and tackle shop recommendations also welcome! 

4. **Hot springs:** Self explanatory, kid friendly would be ideal if it exists! 

5. **Anything traditional or unique:** We like learning about the history and culture of a place. Farms, museums, traditional or unique foods, historical sites, local products etc.

Really enjoying reading through all the old threads on here and the helpful advice—will continue to search through them but I figured because of my particular circumstances I’d write something up here. In addition to my specific questions, I appreciate any and all bits of relevant advice or recommendations! ",0,3.0

Post,Review my itinerary,PostPunkBurrito,2025-02-12 15:05:05,"We are going in August (I know it is the busiest time but it is all my schedule allows). This is the bare bones outline of the trip so far for me, wife and 10 year old.

We had to make some concessions -- rushing the east so we can fit in a day in Thorsmark (which we are super excited about). A very long drive between Akureyri and Grundarfjörður). 

Questions: where can we see Puffins along this itinerary? Is there a natural place here to fit in a relatively easy glacier hike? Anything problematic, something I am not considering or life changing that I am missing (ha)?

Any comments or thoughts are so appreciated-- this community has been essential to my trip planning, thanks so much.

Comment,,tgbarbie,2025-02-12 15:47:52,"We did a similar trip in late August with my 10 and 13 yos.  We did see puffins in Vik, at Reynisfjara. I would definitely plan some time to stop there, maybe afternoon Day 4.  We did a glacier hike through the company Local Guides that you would need to do on the morning of Day 5.  We are a pretty in shape family but it wasn't too much for my 10 year old. They provided the crampons and gear, was a fantastic experience.  Day 6 is a really long day. Try to make the stop at Petra's Stone Collection, we loved it.   May I suggest that instead of driving all the way to Myvatn that day, stop in Egilstadir for the night? The Vok baths there were our favorite hot pool experience, and you can complete the drive on Day 7.  I would stay 2 nights in Myvatn and maybe only 1 in Akureyri. It's a really small city. Day 9 you'll probably explore the north of the Snaefelesness Peninsula, then Day 10, round the bend and explore the south. You can stop in Borgarnes on your drive back to Reykjavik, not sure what you mean by West Coast. 

All of this is just my two cents :)  And also, definitely download the map of Icelandic jumping pillows.  We stopped at so many and it was a great way to take a break from the car and explore small towns, and meet local kids.",2,
Comment,,PostPunkBurrito,2025-02-12 18:17:23,"This is all so great, thank you for taking the time to write this. I am going to take all of this into consideration and likely change some things up. Jumping pillows! Wow, this is the first I am hearing and my kid is going to love this. I don't really know what I mean by West Coast either but I like your suggestion a lot. 

I was very much considering 2 nights in Myvatn and in 1 in Akureyri and changed it at the last minute based on some stuff I read about the midges. Did that not end up being a big issue for you? Did you enjoy your time in Myvatn? 

Thanks again!",2,
Comment,,tgbarbie,2025-02-12 18:28:04,"We didn't stay in Akureyri at all. We stayed in Blonduos on our way from the Snaefelsness Peninsula to break up that drive. So we slept in Blonduos, woke up, drove the northern fjords, got to Akuyeri for lunch, and moved on to Myvatn baths and some of the waterfalls. It POURED the entire time we were in the area so it wasn't our favorite part of the trip. We did all of sites there, didn't make it to Husavik. So we did Myvatn baths, dinner there, slept in Myvatn. Woke up, did all the sites around Myvatn, had our favorite dinner at Vogafjos farm, slept again in Myvatn, and woke up and hit the road. It was nice at that point to stay somewhere for 2 nights. Hardly any midges in August.",2,

Post,11 days in Iceland - help finalizing timing?,Meetthewaldayan,2025-02-11 16:50:09,"Hi All! I will be in Iceland for 11 days in mid-late April. 

I have done a bunch of research and have an itinerary I am generally happy with, except a few issues: 

1. I am wondering if it would be better to spend 2 nights in Snaefelles as my list of sights is long in that area. i could split the sights into two days, with a slightly longer drive day straight to Akureyi on April 17. Is the night in Skagafjordur worth keeping?

2. I'm not sure if two nights in Akureyi makes sense or if I should do one there and one in Myvatn. There are so many sights around Myvatn that it would be a bit frustrating to drive back to Akureyi that day and then back east again to continue the ring road  the next day. However, I've heard that Myvatn itself is not really worth staying in, and I like the idea of being in a place for two nights.

3. April 19/20 are a bit light on activities - maybe that's OK, I don't mind some slower days but maybe there is something worth doing that I'm missing. or combine these days into one long driving day and cut the hotel in Seydisfjordur**?**

4. Should i leave a whole day for the Westman Islands? I could probably add one more day onto this itinerary, though it would hurt a bit because... budget

Comment,,tgbarbie,2025-02-12 16:04:45,"We did this similar trip last year, clockwise, but we did the Golden Circle at the end.  Regarding Snaefelsness, where is the hotel you are planning to stay in those two nights?  We drove out from Reykjavik, stopped in Borgarnes, drove up and did the southern part of the Peninsula, stayed in Arnarstapi, then drove to the tip and did the rest of the Peninsula the next morning. We slept that night in Blonduos to break up the drive.  We never stayed in Akureyri, just drove through, and slept two nights in Myvatn instead. We had one of our best meals there, at the Vogafjos farm restaurant. And our hotel had their own hot pots so that was a really nice amenity.

The drive to Seydisfjordour is STUNNING. If your drive there on 4/19 is at night, you'll miss it. I would sooner stay in Egilstadir and drive in and out of Seydisfjordour in the morning. I don't think you miss much by not sleeping there.  I would cut borgarfjordur and maybe add on Studlagil or Vok baths.

Yeah so 4/20, I would  (we did) wake up in Egilstadir, drive to Seydisfjordour and have breakfast, drive back out and do the whole Eastfjords drive which is STUNNING. We loved Petra's Stone Collection and stopping in some of the small towns. Sleep in Hofn.

We did not do the Westman Islands so I can't speak to that.",1,
Comment,,Meetthewaldayan,2025-02-13 22:11:13,"We are planning to stay at the hotel Snaefelsness - it's about 65km northwest of Bogarnes. We were skipping Bogarnes because all the sights we want to see around Snaefelsness - it Borgarnes particularly worth visiting in your opinion?

Thank you for the restaurant rec in Mytavn!

I will take your advice to stay at Egilstadir instead of Sedisfjordur. I'll cut borgarfjordur too and add in one of the things you suggested - the vok baths look amazing but we already have two hotsprings on the agenda and they really add up! 

Thanks for your thoughtful comment!",1,
Post,June trip,Chloe102,2025-02-10 06:49:39,"Hello Iceland fans! My spouse and I just booked our flights for Iceland for mid June. We are active, outdoorsy people who love to explore. Some of our ideas have been snorkeling, going to lesser known thermal lagoons, lava tube tour, diamond beach and possibly a boat trip to see puffins. I’ve been doing lots of research on places to go and our ultimate debate is a sleeper van vs renting a car and staying at hotels. Any pros and cons on both? Any fun tips or ideas on things to do? Also how early out should we book guided adventures? Thanks! ",0,2.0

Comment,,BTRCguy,2025-02-10 11:03:57,"Sticking with the topic mentioned by u/ibid17 I would say to book a hostel (rather than a hotel) and rent a car rather than a campervan. Hostels are very social, so if you enjoy interacting with other travelers then you will like that. And unless you really prefer fixing your own meals, having a place with a nice breakfast buffet is easier than having to break out a portable kitchen in possible inclement weather to fix your own.",2,
