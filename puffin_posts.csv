Post,1dkc1ey,Best bet for Puffins?,Subject_Personality9,1718891187.0,My wife and I will be traveling to Iceland arriving Aug 29 and departing Sep 3. Trying to organize a trip around most desired things and seeing puffins is at the top of her list (she's a veterinarian and bird lover).  Can anyone 1) help me set our expectations to how much we'd be able to see them on those dates 2) suggest the best place/way‚Äã to see them (both in terms of probability and proximity)? ,12,16
Comment,1dkc1ey,Best bet for Puffins?,letmebebrave430,2024-06-20 18:29:12,"Everyone is saying Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur Eystri, and I agree, but SET YOUR EXPECTATIONS!! (Which I realize you are asking for.) Many of the low star reviews on Google are from people who traveled mid-late August or early September and missed them. It is not guaranteed to see them at that location at the time of year you are traveling, which is really unfortunate.  Even their website states they are only there until mid August. Several reviews state only seeing one or two around August 15th/August 17th. If you do go, morning and evening is best. 

If you have the time I'd swing by because it is the closest you would probably be able to get to them but just realize they might be gone. Hopefully they stay longer this year but I can't make any predictions. Maybe keep and eye on the reviews of each location you're planning on going and sort by newest and see if people mention seeing them!",8,0
Comment,1dkc1ey,Best bet for Puffins?,Adamantium-Aardvark,2024-06-20 17:51:12,"We just went to Borgarfjar√∞arh√∂fn yesterday and saw THOUSANDS of them very up close. They‚Äôre all nesting on this rock, and there‚Äôs a staircase and observation platform going up the rock. You can get within a couple feet of them. They are not afraid or shy. It was amazing. It‚Äôs a 1 hour drive from Egilssta√∞ir in the Eastern part of the country. It‚Äôs free to go. There‚Äôs no tours or even any parking fee. Just show up and observe thousands of puffins for as long as you want.

Bring a warm hat and warm gloves it was quite cold.

Comment,1dkc1ey,Best bet for Puffins?,Sometraveler85,2024-06-20 13:57:21,"If you can spare the time. HIGHLY reccomend Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur eystri.  It's like a dream come true.  Easily accessible,  SUPER close.  You could reach out and snatched them (but don't)  and very dependable.

We raced there straight from the airport driving 12 hours arriving at 10pm. I was so worried we would miss them because it was getting later in July. I DIED and went to heaven. It was insane.",10,0
Comment,1dkc1ey,Best bet for Puffins?,stevenarwhals,2024-06-20 17:51:56,"Borgarfjordur Eystri (aka Bakkagerdi) is the best place to reliably see lots of the but but be aware it's all the way out at the end of the Eastfjords. You would have to dedicate your whole trip to doing the south coast and back to see them there with the number of days you have. That's a fine way to do a trip, especially if puffins are your top priority, but just wanted to make sure you're aware. It's not like it's a day trip or even really a 2-day trip from Reykjavik or anything. The next best spot is probably Latrabjarg in the Westfjords, which is similarly remote. Easier but less reliable places to see them include Dyrholaey and Vestmannaeyjar. There are also boat tours from Reykjavik that go out to some of the little skerries where the puffins hang out. By the end of August, however, it's really up to luck how many are still around in any given place. Some years they hang out longer than others; all depends on the weather, local food supply, etc.",3,0
Comment,1dkc1ey,Best bet for Puffins?,NoLemon5426,2024-06-20 13:51:54,"There will still be puffins in Heimaey. Depending on how the season goes, it might be possible for you to help catch baby puffins (pufflings), babysit them overnight, and then launch them off of cliffs in the morning. Does this sound fun?

Again, timing on this varies but this is about the time of year where puffin rescue begins.

Post,1erg6f9,Any puffins left?,bagheera457,1723575748.0,"Hi! We are in Iceland right now, I know that it is pretty much the end of the season, but I just wanted to check if anyone had any luck seeing puffins anywhere in the last few days...

I have checked the webcam on Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur eystri and it seems empty right now, but maybe there are some times when they are easier to see?

We were thinking about taking the ferry to Heimaey tomorrow, but if there are fou sure not going to be any puffins there we might change our plans and check out something else, there is no lack of things to see ;)

You could do a Whale Watching tour from Reykjavik with a RIB boat, they'll most likely pass by the puffin island, and if the puffins have arrived early then you may see them. I'd recommend the tour with Elding.is, called premium whale watching from Reykjavik. 

A guaranteed way to see puffins would be to do a day trip to the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar), and go to the beluga whale and puffin sanctuary.

Post,1h54fes,Puffin photography spots in June,d0ughb0y1,1733170245.0,"Planning on an Iceland trip in June. Main objective is puffin and landscape photography.

Planning to go to Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur Eystri. This does not travel through F road right? Planning to stay there one night.

Westman Island. Do you recommend day trip or ferry the car and stay a night on Westman Island?

Any other puffin sites good for photography?

I've read for some sites (Dyrh√≥laey, L√°trabjarg?), puffins are on a cliff and quite far, so thinking not ideal for photography.

Thanks",2,7

This is the place where you can photograph them in very close proximity. There are plenty of them. Some are so near that you can even touch them (although you absolutely should not!). You don't need to drive through any F-roads to get there. But you would need to drive into some higher grounds so you'll just need to drive carefully and slow down as necessary.",2,0
