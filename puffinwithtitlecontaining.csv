Post,Puffin photography spots in June,d0ughb0y1,2024-12-02 20:10:45,"Planning on an Iceland trip in June. Main objective is puffin and landscape photography.

Planning to go to Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur Eystri. This does not travel through F road right? Planning to stay there one night.

Westman Island. Do you recommend day trip or ferry the car and stay a night on Westman Island?

Any other puffin sites good for photography?

I've read for some sites (Dyrh√≥laey, L√°trabjarg?), puffins are on a cliff and quite far, so thinking not ideal for photography.

Comment,,hertziceland,2024-12-03 09:15:50,"You're right about Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur Eystri; it‚Äôs a great choice and doesn‚Äôt involve F roads, so you‚Äôll have a smooth drive. Staying overnight is a good idea to catch those early morning and late evening shots when the light is just perfect.

For the Westman Islands, if you can spare the time, I'd recommend staying the night rather than just doing a day trip. It gives you more flexibility to explore and photograph the puffins and the stunning landscapes there without rushing. Plus, the sunset and sunrise are spectacular!

You mentioned Dyrh√≥laey and L√°trabjarg; indeed, puffins can be a bit far on the cliffs which might challenge photography without a good zoom lens. If you're looking for other sites where the puffins might be easier to photograph, consider places like Akurey, St√≥rh√∂f√∞i in Vestmannaeyjar, and Tj√∂rnes Peninsula near H√∫sav√≠k for some fantastic opportunities.

Comment,,Remote_Antelope_8601,2024-08-18 21:50:05,Any insight where Puffin Patrol gathers? I am at the Westman Islands now,1,
Comment,,snizo_,2024-08-19 00:50:53,"I ended up changing my trip to September due to work so all I can tell you is what I've learned from reading care guides! 

1) Puffin Patrol isnt really a gathering of volunteers per se, you just kind of go out on your own at night. Pufflings get confused by artificial light, so in the city or by the harbor are probably your best bets. They can also be found not far from colonies, such as near Heimaklettur, Ei√∞i√∞, and Dalfjall. 

2) Pufflings generally fledge (leave the nest) at the very end of August or early September. Puffling season typically ends ~4 weeks later. August 19th is probably slightly too early to see any pufflings, but you could try calling the Sea Life Trust and asking if they've had any puffling reports yet.  

3) Catching a Puffling:

-After dark, use a flashlight to check under cars, boxes, alleys, etc. for pufflings. Be very careful not to step on a puffling when chasing it! Use clean gloves when catching a puffling. Any standard pair should do, doesn't have to be medical gloves. Puffins are seabirds so they rely on a special oil coating on their feathers to remain waterproof. The oils on human hands can disrupt feather waterproofing if handled too much. Hold the bird with its wings pressed against its sides to prevent any injuries from flapping/wiggling. 

-After catching the puffling, place it in a cardboard box. You can also place grass at the bottom to help avoid pufflings from getting their own feces on them. This is a very stressful experience for them so keeping them in a dark, safe environment helps calm the bird. Be sure to use a box with proper airflow, but not holes big enough for the bird to escape or injure itself. Most local hotels and businesses can give you a box or assist you in finding one. Avoid handling the bird once it is in the box - remember these are wild animals that need rescuing and too much human interaction can be harmful! 

-DO NOT feed the bird. Oils from fish placed in the box can harm the feathers. 

-Ideally only keep 1 bird per box. 


4) Releasing a Puffling:

-Pufflings MUST be released the next morning. If your puffling seems injured, lethargic, or underweight (underweight birds have a very prominent and pointy breastbone rather than a rounded one) please take it to the Sea Life Trust where a rehab team can give it medical attention! You can also bring your healthy bird to the Sea Life Trust in the morning to get it checked out & weighed for researcher data. 

-If your bird is healthy you can go release it! DO NOT release it in the harbor, as oils from ships can damage the feathers. Popular release spots include cliffs, beaches, or boats out at sea away from human activity. 

-When releasing the bird, hold it firmly around the midsection but do not cover the wings. Toss your arms up gently one or two times before releasing the bird to allow it to feel the wind and prepare for flight. Toss your bird into the air over the water. At this point, many pufflings WILL NOT fly - that is okay! Often pufflings will sit on the water for a second or two before diving below. Whether your puffling flys or dives is perfectly fine. 

5) Remember that Puffin Patrol is a rescue effort! Pufflings are not pets and should be handled, treated, and respected as wild animals. As exciting as it is to see a puffling, please act safely and responsibly when on patrol. 

Hope this helps!",3,
Comment,,aim4444,2024-12-11 15:45:24,"Did you end up going in September? If so, what was your experience? I am debating going in May or September with my primary interest being puffins. If I go in September, I would love to participate in puffin patrol however I'm curious if this is easy to do or frowned upon as a tourist? I would want to participate respectfully! Any insight would be great.",1,
Comment,,snizo_,2024-12-11 16:04:27,"

If you go in May you'll see adult puffins - if you go in September you MIGHT see pufflings. If your primary goal is to see puffins I'd probably go in May. 

In September the adult puffins have all gone out to sea and most of the pufflings are gone too. I ended up seeing one puffling by the Westman Islands harbor on September 14th around 10:15pm, but that was very unexpected. No one was out doing puffin patrol except us, and we got worried that we looked sketchy so finished by 11:30 or so. My understanding is that tourists are welcome to join in puffling patrol so long as you're being respectful (see my guide below), but if you're visiting specifically for puffling patrol I'd plan to go during late August or during the very first few days of September when everyone else is out.",1,

While you‚Äôre there, I really recommend Puffin Adventures (puffin.is). It‚Äôs run by 2 brothers who are super knowledgeable about the geography, wildlife, and culture of the area (they live in the village and were fishermen before starting their business). The rest of the pictures are from our tour but the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. It was the high point of an already phenomenal trip. It‚Äôs a little RIB so you feel like you are flying with the puffins and other sea birds when on the ocean and you get to go into all these hidden coves along the coast. We also saw seals and the day before they saw whales, so it is more than just a puffin trip.

The final picture is so you can see all the safety gear in case you‚Äôre worried! As someone who gets super sea sick, I would do this again in a heart beat!!!

Can't find much about the specifics of this place but lots of puffin articles recommend walking to these cliffs, yet I'm struggling to find it on the map.

If this is the correct spot where would the nearest appropriate parking be before making the walk to the cliffs and is this area accessible during early august? I've heard that possibly it gets closed because of the nesting.

There seems to be a road on maps directly to the lighthouse but street view shows it gated off and there isn't a clear parking area on the satellite image.

Or maybe I'm looking in completely the wrong place, would appreciate your help!

Comment,,Fywe,2023-04-03 11:24:51,"Poor crash landing puffin!

That being said, I'm going to hijack your post in case someone wants to photograph our birbs this spring/summer: please **please do not fly drones anywhere near their nests.** (Looks like OP used a camera/phone, so I'm not bashing you!)

The parents are very protective of their eggs/chicks. Drones are *scary* for a bird. I've witnessed a seagull attack a drone, before we managed to get to the owner and ask them to move the drone away. The seagull won (yeah, we cheered), but it could have gotten hurt and thus leaving its eggs/chicks without a parent. It might also scare them off the nest long enough for the eggs to cool down and die. We don't want that.

Don't be idiots, be respectful of the wildlife.

We were there a day ago, there were some puffins, super adorable as well we've seen some belugas. The whole thing is not like super interactive, but I feel it's a good thing, they're there not to entertain. So in general it was cool to support the sanctuary as it seems that they have a good cause (they share their story there which is neat). 
So all in all it was good for us, puffins are clumsy and cute to see, especially when it is not possible to see them on the coast  (but if you'll go there, there's also one bigger bird with the puffins, he swims like crazy, blew me away :D)",6,

Post,Trip Report 8/19-8/28 Ring Road Puffin Chase (album included),OhhSoBlessed,2021-08-28 19:23:25,"Trip Report 8/19-8/28 Ring Road Puffin Chase (album included)

**THANK YOU ALL.**This community. Your trip reports. All the information. You all helped us so much along the way, so I wanted to give back and submit our own experience. 

**Us:** Enthusiastic 29 year olds on our first international trip together. Americans (Warm blooded Floridians‚Ä¶). Runners. Bird enthusiasts. Not vegetarians but largely plant based in our food choices. Interested in Norse mythology. Our travels are normally ambitious and relatively fast paced. 

**Main reasons to visit Iceland:** Reykjavik marathon. Puffins. Epic fantasy novelesque landscapes along the ring road.

**Preparation:** Rapid COVID tests at CVS. War room created with a large Iceland map and several potential stops and points of interest listed. All accommodations booked (largely hotels). ‚ÄúMini‚Äù rental car booked through Eurocar. His name was Yarry the Yaris and he took care of us. Also we had been training 3 months for the Reykjavik marathon, which, 2 weeks prior to the trip got CANCELLED. Bummer. But understandable! COVID is as COVID does. Using Visa and Discover credit cards (Visa was way more reliable). We ranked points of interests, such as waterfalls vs gorges vs canyons vs caves vs geysers vs hot springs vs cities vs islands etc.

**Experiences will be listed Tier 1-4.**
1‚Äôs are trip highlights and 4‚Äôs were absolutely fine. Cities are not tiered because for us Iceland is about what we did between cities more than what we did in them. Let me clarify, there were zero bad experiences, but a few we could have been comfortable with skipping.

**Trip highlights (Tier 1)-**
Dyrh√≥laey - Puffins at dusk (around 7pm)
Glymur - incredible
Reykjavik marathon
Tattoo at Aura Reykjavik with Anna
Fri√∞heimar (Tomato greenhouse)
Waterfall Circle hike

[Album of Iceland Highlights](https://imgur.com/gallery/rsB0RqC)

**Tips and insights:**
-Yes you will hit a ton of one way bridges, but in all of Iceland and the ring road we only drove by two accidents. Always keep your headlights on and take it slow but confidently
-You will drive in heavy heavy fog or gravel or both. That was probably 30% of our driving overall and often you can only see 1-2 poles. Make peace with it, use google maps, and take is slow!
-The gift shops all have the same stuff, and not a ton of it is high quality
-When in doubt, fill up your gas tank!
-Usually worth it to have breakfast at your hotel or accommodation. Going out for breakfast turned into baked goods/yogurt for us.
-Puffins arrive around 7pm or dusk as well as at sunrise. Few and far between mid day.
-Yes, Iceland is expensive. But yes it is worth it üòç
-Golden Circle felt less adventurous.
-At no point did I feel like we did not have enough time despite the relatively short ring road trip. If I did it again, I would definitely have planned some more Sna√¶ffeless peninsula time in but otherwise we did not feel constrained. 
-You have to try to actually pronounce everything. All words and locations for the entertainment of your company. It‚Äôs a rule.


**8/19 KEF to Reykjavik**
-Arrival
-Blue Lagoon (Tier 2 experience)
-11 hours to sleep off the jetlag and prep for our run

Arrival in the morning around 6:30am via United. Smooth flight from Newark, adorable airplane food. KEF was not busy at all and everyone was super kind. Picked up our rental car from Eurocar, which was a very pleasant and easy experience. Trawire WiFi picked up outside KEF which also worked surprisingly well for the duration of the trip. 

We had some time to waste before our 12pm Blue Lagoon reservation. So we simply galavanted along the Reykjanesb√¶r peninsula south of the KEF to the the continental divide, lava pools, a geothermal area, and a coastal ledge (ALL TIER 4) to take some pictures of a few birds, namely we found some Arctic Terns which were on the priority list. 

After a quick power nap in the car at Blue Lagoon (10 hours flight transit and no sleep in a day or two‚Ä¶) we had a lovely experience at the Blue Lagoon (Tier 2 but close to Tier 1!). Okay, I know it‚Äôs touristy, but we had to do it, and what a wonderful introduction to Iceland. We did the cheaper option which did not include the robe or extra mud mask, which would not have heightened our experience much at all.

Maybe took 15 minutes to get us in through the line. Showered off, and scurried through the cold into the toasty silica waters. The water had a soft wonderful feeling and the cyan blue colors popped! Every entry comes with a drink (limited menu but alas, a nice touch that is not inclusive at Sky Lagoon) thus my girlfriend and I helped ourselves to some Prosecco and waded a few laps around the pools in search of the hottest spots. Spent maybe 1.5 hours in the water, put on the silica mud mask, and overall had a great time. There were several folks here, certainly of a more touristy variety, but there was enough space to get that cheesy Blue Lagoon secluded photo that you see from every Iceland trip.

Of note, we did not eat there as the food was rather expensive. Plus we wanted to catch a lovely dinner in Reykjavik.

Drove to the city. Of note there are very few stop sign but rather many yield signs.

Got to our hotel (Center Hotel by Harpa). Walked along the main stretches to get some Thai food (carb loading!) And got to sleep around 6pm because we were exhausted and had a marathon to run in the morning üèÅüèÅüèÅ

**8/20 Reykjavik**
-Islandsbanki Reykjav√≠k Marathon -Tier 1
-Tattoo from Aura Reykjavik- Tier 1
-Volcano hike path C- Tier 2

So the marathon we trained for got cancelled, which stinks, but they were trying to be safe and I can respect that. The company running the race allowed us to pick up medals after our run PLUS they uploaded the course map on google maps so we could easily follow the exact route. This was my girlfriend‚Äôs first marathon and my third. Mind you we are slow but alas, we try so hard üòÖ. After a high spirited 5 hours and 54 minutes we completed the tour de Reykjavik on foot! Parks, lighthouses, waterfalls, the Sun Voyager, Harpa, museums, bridges, mountains, rainbow roads, several runners doing exactly what we were doing who offered positivity along the way. And with that we are marathoners! I personally fell in love with the city somewhere around the first mile. Got our beautiful medals featuring Harpa and the lighthouse and got ready to celebrate our hard work the rest of the trip.

Okay I‚Äôll be real with you. 90% of this trip was to see Puffins ü¶Ü üêß. Top 1 bucket list bird. Mind you we knew they would migrating any day in late August so we took a risk by coming when we did. We planned to get matching tattoos which feature puffins (I know how lame that sounds üòÇ but we own it). A fun representation of our trip, our marathon, our relationship. We booked with Anna at Aura Reykjavik, which was a stunningly beautiful studio. 

Anna was the perfect example of what you want an artist to be. She was super personable, extremely cautious and methodical with sanitation practices, and was very patient to understand the ideas behind the tattoos. The tattoos are beautiful. Better than we imagined. Highly recommend Anna! Overall, one of our favorite experiences.

Now, this is where we are a little nutty. We were enthusiastic, feeling good, and the volcano was popping (check webcams y‚Äôall). We grabbed some to go fried hot dogs (they were super okay btw) and headed to catch some night volcano action üåã. Path C, Tier 2 experience.

Our luck. As soon as we get there the volcano, which was bubbling all day, had stopped. We did the hike with headlamps to the webcam viewpoint, which was fairly heavily trafficked and moderate difficulty given the elevation gain. Heavy wind, slight rain that was suspiciously like snow flurries, and the cold made our time there fairly short, but we did manage to see one or two lava bubbles before it really calmed. That and we were exhausted ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Final step count, 70k steps each ü§™. What an opener!

**8/21 Reykjavik to Dalv√≠k**
-GLYMUR Tier 1
-Koluglj√∫fur Canyon/waterfall Tier 2

Slept in. I mean, can you blame us? Had breakfast as it was closing at our hotel and moseyed our way to the car and up the coast. Today was a travel day without a ton of expectations. Maybe a few stops on the way of course but largely the goal was to make it up to the sleepy town of Dalvik.

Had seen some grumbles about a neat hike called Glymur, Iceland‚Äôs second tallest waterfall. Holy guacamole. The views were otherworldly. An absolute highlight of the trip. Moderate to difficult hike with 1000+feet of climb but oh man is it worth it. We took the well marked path counterclockwise, traverse a small cave, and cross a river with a hand bridge, then the fun begins with a climb straight into the setting of an epic fantasy novel. Lord of The Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter type scenes. A massive gorge with several viewpoints. Fulmars circling throughout the canyon in the twisting winds. A final boss type scene with a threatening waterfall at the end that you walk around at the peak. Does require walking across the river at the top. Socks and shoes removed but the cold water and hard small rocks were rather unforgiving.

The whole hike took us around 3-4 hours and was absolutely worth it. If you can than you must!

Gas station food is more like the US equivalent of fast casual establishments. We found a delicious tandoori chicken salad and fueled up with some caffeinated seltzer‚Äôs throughout. Also the Skyr yogurt was my jam.

Another small stop at a fun little waterfall a bit of the ways off the main road. This was a particularly lovely experience given that we were largely alone at the waterfall and got some practice with our fancy camera settings to make it a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù waterfall.

Strolled into Dalvik, a sleepy fishing town, picked up a to go pizza. And returned to ‚ÄúThe Love Shack‚Äù which was an adorable tiny spot by the city where we had pizza and wine and basked in the Icelandic north.

**8/22 Dalv√≠k to Akureyri**
-Grimsey Island TIER 3
-Explored Akureyri (clown ice cream ü§°)

Hopped on the ferry to Grimsey Island which is famous for having some of the biggest puffin populations in the world. 3 hour ferry was smooth and peaceful and a lovely break from driving. Spent 5 hours on the island and got lovely pictures of a large variety of birds. The Terns were hilarious and dive bomb you if you walk the road south to the lighthouse because they are good and protective parents. This could definitely deter folks since there are a hundreds but none ever made contact with us.

*Neat birds*
-Arctic Terns (üõ¨üí£)
-Brunnich‚Äôs Gueillmont
-Golden something or other
-Purple sandpiper
-Seagulls galore
-Harlequin Ducks
-Snow bunting
-Petrels
-6 distant puffins on a cliff (exciting but unsatisfactory on the Puffin-o-meter

Overall the island was cool but not necessarily worth it unless you go during puffin season and that is your jam. It was neat to see. The boat was calming. You can order ‚ÄúFried Black Seabird‚Äù at the restaurant (which is appalling). But alas, wasn‚Äôt exactly what we hoped for, which was a close puffin encounter.

Returned via ferry after 5 quick hours on the island (we walked end to end). Drove over to the second biggest city in Iceland Akureyri, and found a lovely vegetarian dinner and walked for ice cream.

Recommend taking a stroll along the water, by all the heart shaped red lights, and stopping at the oldest ‚Äúall natural‚Äù ice cream spot in the North, Brynja. Channel your younger self to get the clown ice cream ü§° no regrets.

Slept in hostel ‚Äúpod,‚Äù which was fairly hot because of a heat wave in the north, showered, and went on our way.

**8/23 Akureyri to Laugarfell**
-Go√∞afoss low Tier 2
-M√Ωvatn
      -Grj√≥tag√° (GoT sex cave) Tier 3
      -Hverfjall crater Tier 2
-Stu√∞lagil canyon tier 3
-Sigurgeir‚Äôs Bird Museum Tier 4
-Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur eystri  Tier 4

Busy busy day. Well‚Ä¶ tbh they all were but today felt especially so.

We woke early and had the classic bakery and Skyr breakfast on the go. Caught Godafoss early before anyone arrived but the fog started to become a theme at this point. üå´ the falls was still neat. Easy stop off the road and short walk to the falls. We did the East side which allows you to climb down up close and personal. 

A quick gaunt down around Myvatn was beautiful. As you might have read, the midges are a real thing. One must choose between windy spots or midgey spots when visiting Myvatn but from what I read ymmv. We quickly stopped at the GoT sex cave which I felt was underwhelming, then took a walk around the Hverfell Crater which was a pleasant surprise. Fairly easy walk/climb and you get to see beautiful and varied landscapes in each direction. Mountains, lava fields, a mystical lake. We hit a clear day which helped and the rather windy winds kept the bugs at bay. 

Quick stop at the bird museum, as we are bird enthusiasts, was neat, but overall could have been skipped. Very small, very helpful in IDing birds. But nothing to write home about. And that is coming from a bird enthusiast. Myvatn was overall very pleasant to drive through.

Quick stop at Stu√∞lagil canyon. This was one of those rare moments where we may have been on the wrong side of the canyon and there were far too many people to get a decent picture or to fully enjoy. Plus we were spoiled with Glymur.

We had a long, slow, foggy but nonetheless beautiful drive to our rather remote next location, Laugerfell. We took and hour detour to the East Coast to check it out and because we had a lead on those elusive clown birds. No puffins to speak of, but enthusiasm and positive puffin mentality remained intact.

Our stay was at a quirky small hotel/campground with shared bathrooms way up in the mountains.

**8/24 Lagarfell to Vik**
-Laugarfell Loop (Waterfall circle hike üöø )Tier 1
-Diamond beach- Tier 1.5
-Fja√∞r√°rglj√∫fur Beiber canyon - Tier 2.5
-Dyhr√≥laey -Tier 1

Early morning wake up time. The main reason for our accommodation was that it was at the trailhead of the waterfall circle hike, which was about 5 miles and passed three magnificent and very different waterfalls. Absolutely recommend the trek up to this one. Not to mention we never saw another soul on the trail. Well marked, often with wooden bridges to trek along. Had breakfast at the hotel and made our way on our longest drive yet.

Quick note here. Sometimes, fueling up when you are above a half tank of gas is the only reasonable option. Small scare on the foggy mountainous drive where we may or may not have made Yarry the Yaris get us to a gas station on nothing but fumes. Thank goodness empty doesn‚Äôt mean empty üòÖ

Made it to Diamond beach to help break up the drive. Pleasantly surprised by the quick stop. Great waves, smooth black stoned and sand beaches, and of course the glaciers and ice chunks being the star of the show. Climbing the ice chunks, freezing your butt off, taking artsy pictures, skipping rocks. This stop was a pleasant surprise and a genuinely neat-o place! A seal ü¶≠ greeted us hello and goodbye as well. There is a banksy mural under the bridge btw!

Next stop was Fja√∞r√°rglj√∫fur, Beiber canyon. If you haven‚Äôt seen Justin Bieber‚Äôs music video featuring this canyon then you are probably better off‚Ä¶ but alas we wanted to check it out. If I were a dragon, I would absolutely live in that canyon. There is a small rubber matted hike along the top with a few viewpoints. We caught it when it was somewhat rainy and there were quite a few folk there. I think I enjoyed it more than my girlfriend (she prefers no railings along the entire path) but again, I think we were spoiled by Glymur. Worth the stop though!

Last but not the very least, our strongest puffin lead. Dyrholaey. 

Peak Puffining is around 7pm folks. We found the Mecca! Maybe 50 puffins the first day and hundreds the second. The cliffs are roped off but there were so many puffins it was impossible to not get a close encounter. They doodled out of there holes and onto the tops of the grassy cliffs. They are not shy about people and several even seemed to be posing for us. We got so many amazing puffin shots that we are still giddy about. 100% this day alone made the trip for us. Apparently this is the place where puffins arrive the latest and leave the latest in the season. And they didn‚Äôt disappoint us one bit.

**8/24 Vik**
-Black Sand Beach Tier 2
-Solheimajokull Glacier hike Tier 2
-Vik horseback riding on the beach Tier 2
-Dryh√≥laey again for more puffins‚Ä¶ Tier 1

Woke up and walked from our cabin down to Black Sand Beach. Saw a few puffins in the distance but had a great time avoiding waves and exploring caves. Cool spot! And the restaurant there (Black Sand Beach Restaurant) was pretty tasty at that.

We booked only two guided tours the entire trip. We did this on purpose since both of us are pretty quick to get up and get ready. We aren‚Äôt the best at waiting on groups‚Ä¶ the glacier hike at Solhmjokull gave us insight into the time that tours take in order to ensure proper safety for the masses. The glacier hike was a 2.5 hour experience and maybe half that was actually spent on the glacier. The rest was waiting on folks to properly get crampons on their feet, to have the guide explain safety protocol, to and to generally wait for people to traverse creeks and rocks and whatnot.

The actual hike on the glacier was dope. The guide did a great and thorough job explaining the geology, safety, and taking pictures of us when appropriate. Very unique, very informative, and getting to use the ice pick and crampons was a blast. Overall, left the glacier feeling like it was a great experience and worth it for the diversity. 

The horse back riding out of Vik was in a similar vein. Icelandic horses are not the same as in the US. Smaller and spunky as well as with longer hair. The experience felt Unique, slow going, and like an ‚Äòappreciate the beauty around you‚Äô kind of an experience. Maybe 10 or so people in the group. They let us pick up speed on a small trail and let us take pictures on the horses together. Riding on the black sand wasn‚Äôt exactly romantic but a nice tough. Plus they take the horses maybe 100meters through a river. The guides did a great job as well. Kind, talkative. And they gave us bird facts! (Apparently the birds in the road, the Fulmars, are juveniles and cannot fly, and will throw up on you if you try to relocate them‚Ä¶)

To round the day out, we came back to Dyrh√≥laey to the puffin cliffs to get a few more pictures. Still foggy but still amazing. 7pm is the time for prime puffin peeking, people.

**8/25 Vik to Keflav√≠k**
-Seljalandsfoss and Glj√∫frab√∫i 2.5
-Gullfoss Tier 4
-Fri√∞heimar Tomato Tier 1
-Phallological Museum.. yeah‚Ä¶Tier 2

Figured as we finished out the ring, we would hit a few golden circle spots too since it was on our way. This section was definitely more heavily trafficked and had a generally older and slower clientele which is by no means a bad thing. 

Did we stop at Dyrholaey early morning for more puffin action? Yes. The answer is yes.

Stopped by the two neat waterfalls you can walk behind. I particularly liked the second one that is a short walk from the more famous Seljalandsfoss. You climb along a river into an opening that absolutely could serve as a unicorn home in a fantasy novel. One of the more unique waterfalls for sure. The first waterfall was cool, but only just. As we left, your busses started to show up and we quickly made our way over to Gullfoss.

Okay, full transparency, we were waterfalled out at this point. Gulfoss was a super cool waterfall and a short walk from the parking lot. Heavily trafficked, which took away from the experience a bit. Nice bathrooms and gift shop. Met a cool raven! Which was probably my favorite part.

The tomato greenhouse, which was only open 4 hours of the day, was amazing. They were fully booked but had an area where you could get soup and bread from the bar as well as a bloody mary, tomato ice cream, and tomato and apple pie. Tomatoes are one of my favorite foods, so this was a layup. Busy, probably not the best to be there right when it opens at noon, but it cleared out after 20 minutes. If I came back to Iceland I would absolutely book a guided tour here to learn more. 

Rounded out he day by grabbing dinner in Reykjavik for a meal and the penis museum. Unfortunately, not in that order. This one was so much better than the bird museum, it‚Äôs not even funny. A bunch of fun facts, disturbing displays, and overall, I loved it. Well put together. They even gathered all the available information on folklore penises such as elves and dwarves üòÇüòÖ nice way to end I suppose‚Ä¶

Post,Puffin Question for Upcoming Trip,Phototurtle70,2018-11-08 14:30:08,"Greetings!

My wife and I are visiting Iceland April 11 and staying about 10 days. We were wondering ( please see attached map ) if this was a good place to see puffins? I read that they were located on Heimaey and you can take the ferry to get there.

Are they still there during that time of year? Is there a ferry you have to put your car on, or can you park on the main land? And lastly, if you don't take your car, is it a short or long walk to get from the ferry to where you can view the birds?

I appologize in advance for all the questions. We are wanting to be as informed as possible before our trip. Trying to make the most out of our time.

I've already planned out my whole trip (with booked excursions) so I won't be in Reykjavik until the final 2 days of my trip. I suppose there was a reason I was going to book this last since it's near the bottom of my list of things to do. Any suggestions???? I know the other big colony is on Heimaey or Vestmannaeyjabaer or even Papey but I didn't leave enough time out of those places either. I may have to suck it up though and either miss it or cut into my other activities in other places. My other thought was to not do a tour and just hope I see them when I'm at Dyrholaey.

**Edit:** There does seem to be one ""puffin"" tour that is running that date. It's a combined whale watching and puffin tour that's 2 hours and over $200.

As for the Icelandic diet, they tend not to consume much in the way of Puffin meat, and whale meat is almost exclusively sold to tourists and as exports. Puffin is considered a delicacy, but it's not part of the average Icelandic diet.

  These are not mutually exclusive things!

>I can't understand it. It's not about eating meat.

  Sure, I can understand the sentiment and mystique, but if done in a sustainable fashion, seems no more harmful than the harvesting of farm animals, wild game, or fish. Yes? 

>As for the Icelandic diet, they tend not to consume much in the way of Puffin meat,

  Right, but the Icelandic diet consists heavily of the above. The majority of animal products Icelanders consume (fish and seafood, dairy, livestock) are procured from the natural environment in a similar fashion and at much higher volumes - fish and seafood products are by and far away Iceland's largest exports.  

>but I do find it unfathomable as to why you'd want to go to a country where you can see an otherwise hard to see animal and watch it being killed, or eat it.

  From some cursory Wikipedia research (see below), it seems that lack of food supply, if anything has contributed significantly to the puffins' decline in Iceland. Again, no wildlife expertise here, but the culprit, as is the case with many dwindling animal populations, is expanded human activity, habitat loss, and food source loss, rather than hunting efforts.

So in reality, simply going to Iceland to view the puffins (and thereby contributing to increased demand for Icelandic development, industrialization, and food supply chain to support increased human activity and tourism), one may be doing significantly more detriment to the puffin population than previously imagined.  

  Just food for thought - no pu(ffi)n intended. 

>In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland's puffins breed, the birds were almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a thirty-year ban on hunting was put in place. When stocks recovered, a different method of harvesting was used and now hunting is maintained at a sustainable level. Nevertheless, a further hunting ban covering the whole of Iceland was called for in 2011, **although the puffin's lack of recent breeding success was being blamed on a diminution in food supply rather than overharvesting**. Since 2000, a sharp population decline has been seen in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands and Greenland.

If you took a whale or puffin boat tour out of Reykjavik, how was it? What did you like about your particular tour operator? Would you do the same tour again?",2,5.0
Comment,,mustseeiniceland,2017-06-08 17:08:12,"Oh, I hope they reply before you need to decide. If you want to see puffins in a small group on a traditional fishing boat in Reykjav√≠k, I recommend the family run business Happy tours - they're awesome! They also have whale watching and sea angling. I looooved the sea angling tour:

Comment,,idratherbflying,2017-06-25 23:38:20,"Thanks for this recommendation-- I booked a puffin tour with them. Snorri and Kristey gave me a splendid tour, with lots of close puffin views. I'd go back to do an angling tour happily.",1,
Post,Puffin; where to eat in in Reykjavik Feb 2017?,267Jg867,2017-02-24 17:28:41,"Hello All,

Looking for recommendations on where to find the best prepared Puffin dishes in Reykjavik or nearby surroundings in late February, 2017. Would prefer a very high quality restaurant where the bird is prepared very well. Cost no object. Thank you!",2,3.0

Post,Puffin eggs as food. Are these real thing?,Weyzza,2016-10-27 14:56:36,"My friend told me that we could find real puffin eggs as a dish or a snack. Is it really true? If so, where can I find it.

I could find ""Icelandic puffin eggs,"" but the eggs were only chocolate licorice.",1,4.0
Comment,,Unknown,2016-10-27 18:47:06,I wouldn't eat Puffin or puffin eggs.  They are endangered (and beautiful).,6,
Comment,,always_wear_pyjamas,2016-10-27 16:45:06,"Haven't heard about it, but lots of other eggs are eaten. The puffin eggs are kind of hard to get to, and with the current state of the puffin population I'm sure or at least I hope that most people wouldn't go that far.

Edit: in some tourist places you can find different types of candy repackaged and with stupid labels like this. Maybe one of them is ""puffin eggs"". Another one is ""lava sparks"", and costs three times as much with that label.",3,
Comment,,chouettez,2016-10-27 19:30:04,I don't know about puffin eggs but usually you can eat puffin in Iceland. However the puffin population hasn't been doing so good these last few years so hunting them and eating them has been banned for some time. ,3,

Post,Puffin spotting just off the ring road? Also other recommendations needed for a rushed trip.,oogiewoogie,2016-05-18 01:45:12,"I'm in Akureyri right now and have 5 days left of this road trip. We are going clockwise back towards Reykjavik. Just wondering what's a good spot in the northeast, eastern and southern coast to spot puffins and hopefully be able to pick up one. Somewhere not too far from the ring road.

Also any recommendations for hot springs? We are already hitting Myvatn nature baths tomorrow but would like one more enroute in a couple of days. Also volcano exploration or glacier climbing?

These things would check off my bucket list for Iceland.",1,3.0
Comment,,rrmf,2016-05-18 07:42:31,"There are areas where puffins nest in a few spots along the east and south coasts (map: http://icelandmag.visir.is/article/spotting-puffins-here-our-map-showing-best-places-around-iceland) but please don't try to pick one up! They are wild animals and, like all wildlife, should be respected.",1,
Comment,,cks12,2016-05-18 20:03:15,Saw hundreds of Puffins at the black sand beach in Vik. Go to the main side by the Black Sand Restaurant and climb the hill behind the restaurant for a fantastic view of the beach and get closer to the birds.,1,
Comment,,Lisgan,2016-05-18 20:30:31,"Dyrholaey just west of Vik has a cliff where puffins nest just yards from where you can park. But to reiterate /u/rrmf 's point, please do not pick them up or go closer to them than the low rope boundary around the cliffs. It's there not only to protect the birds from interference but also to preserve the cliffs themselves yet every time I visit there are people clambering around and thrusting cameras at the birds. Please respect the flora and fauna wherever you are in Iceland!

Also check out Bakkagerdi in east Iceland, it's about an hour or so on rough roads off route 1 but it's set up specifically for people to get close to the birds but not too close.

Early morning and evening are the best times to see puffins.

Have a great trip!",1,

Pretty sure you can get h√°karl and whale in stores, not sure about puffin.

Comment,,kthg,2015-07-31 14:10:38,"You can get the fermented shark and some delicious minke whale in almost every supermarket but the puffin is a lot harder to come by. This year it'll only be allowed to hunt them for three days in Vestmannaeyjar (Next week I think?) and I'm not sure about other locations. Some years it's even strictly prohibited to hunt them. 

But as I said, shark and minke whale can be found almost everywhere! ",1,
