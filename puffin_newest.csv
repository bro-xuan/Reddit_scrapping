Post,Is there room for the Westman Islands in this itinerary?,horseyhiker,2025-02-16 22:48:17,"Here is my mid-June high level itinerary.  I'm trying to decide if it's realistic to include the Westman Islands if we don't stay overnight.  I'll be with my 78yo Dad, so we won't be doing long hikes.  It sounds like we can see Puffins in Vik, so I don't want to go to Westman just to see them.  I really want to see Diamond Beach.

Day 1: arrive in KEF at 10pm

Day 2: start at Rey; drive Golden Circle; overnight in Selfoss

Day 3: drive to Vik; overnight in Vik

Day 4: drive to Hofn and back to Vik; overnight in Vik

Day 5: drive to Rey; overnight in Rey

Day 6: whale watching in Rey; drive to Blue Lagoon.  Overnight in KEF

Comment,,jessica_wanders,2025-02-16 23:18:25,Day 2 or 5. Yes you can see puffins in Dyrhólaey but you can get closer to them on Heimaey. There’s also a beautiful small stave church. The beluga whale sanctuary is right in town and has a puffin rescue. Great view as you approach the islands. Worth a day trip if you have time.,3,
Post,Where to stay outside of Reykjavík with three year old in April?,La_Juche_Vita,2025-02-12 16:45:26,"TL;DR: Where should spouse, young kid and I stay outside of Reykjavik in late April? 

My spouse, kid (3yo) and I are going to Iceland at the end of April. We’ll be there for 7 days and plan on spending about half in Reykjavik and half somewhere else, and renting a car for the duration. My main two questions are: 

A) What will we need in a vehicle? (Size, 4WD, AWD, 2WD, etc.). Driving in icy/snowy conditions with a compact 2WD and snow tires is common where we’re from, but we don’t want to assume the conditions will be similar.

B) Where should we stay for our outside of Reykjavik portion, given the time of year and our interests? General area, specific town, or accommodations recommendations all appreciated.

Our interests (in approximate order of priority), and sub-questions:

1. **Puffins:** The kid loves puffins and it would mean a lot to see some in real life. I noticed most of the boat tours don’t start until the first week of May, and don’t let kids under 5 or so on board anyways. Are there any places you can (likely) see them from land at the end of April, or family friendly boat tours? Would be interested in other kinds of birdwatching as well.

2. **Unique geology/nature:** We all love hiking, and have a good rig for carrying the kid if necessary, but don’t want to be going anywhere too treacherous or that requires an all-day trek. We prefer DIYing it, but will splurge for a guided tour if necessary. What are accessible must-sees? Which part of the island is worth focusing on?

3. **Saltwater fishing:** Would be willing to hire a charter, but similar to puffin tours I’m mostly seeing this starting up in May—any charters that would operate at the end of April or is it dangerous? Failing that, any towns with piers/shorelines where people fish from land? Shore-targetable species and tackle shop recommendations also welcome! 

4. **Hot springs:** Self explanatory, kid friendly would be ideal if it exists! 

5. **Anything traditional or unique:** We like learning about the history and culture of a place. Farms, museums, traditional or unique foods, historical sites, local products etc.

Really enjoying reading through all the old threads on here and the helpful advice—will continue to search through them but I figured because of my particular circumstances I’d write something up here. In addition to my specific questions, I appreciate any and all bits of relevant advice or recommendations! ",0,3.0
Post,Review my itinerary,PostPunkBurrito,2025-02-12 15:05:05,"We are going in August (I know it is the busiest time but it is all my schedule allows). This is the bare bones outline of the trip so far for me, wife and 10 year old.

We had to make some concessions -- rushing the east so we can fit in a day in Thorsmark (which we are super excited about). A very long drive between Akureyri and Grundarfjörður). 

Questions: where can we see Puffins along this itinerary? Is there a natural place here to fit in a relatively easy glacier hike? Anything problematic, something I am not considering or life changing that I am missing (ha)?

Any comments or thoughts are so appreciated-- this community has been essential to my trip planning, thanks so much.

Comment,,tgbarbie,2025-02-12 15:47:52,"We did a similar trip in late August with my 10 and 13 yos.  We did see puffins in Vik, at Reynisfjara. I would definitely plan some time to stop there, maybe afternoon Day 4.  We did a glacier hike through the company Local Guides that you would need to do on the morning of Day 5.  We are a pretty in shape family but it wasn't too much for my 10 year old. They provided the crampons and gear, was a fantastic experience.  Day 6 is a really long day. Try to make the stop at Petra's Stone Collection, we loved it.   May I suggest that instead of driving all the way to Myvatn that day, stop in Egilstadir for the night? The Vok baths there were our favorite hot pool experience, and you can complete the drive on Day 7.  I would stay 2 nights in Myvatn and maybe only 1 in Akureyri. It's a really small city. Day 9 you'll probably explore the north of the Snaefelesness Peninsula, then Day 10, round the bend and explore the south. You can stop in Borgarnes on your drive back to Reykjavik, not sure what you mean by West Coast. 

All of this is just my two cents :)  And also, definitely download the map of Icelandic jumping pillows.  We stopped at so many and it was a great way to take a break from the car and explore small towns, and meet local kids.",2,
Post,11 days in Iceland - help finalizing timing?,Meetthewaldayan,2025-02-11 16:50:09,"Hi All! I will be in Iceland for 11 days in mid-late April. 

I have done a bunch of research and have an itinerary I am generally happy with, except a few issues: 

1. I am wondering if it would be better to spend 2 nights in Snaefelles as my list of sights is long in that area. i could split the sights into two days, with a slightly longer drive day straight to Akureyi on April 17. Is the night in Skagafjordur worth keeping?

2. I'm not sure if two nights in Akureyi makes sense or if I should do one there and one in Myvatn. There are so many sights around Myvatn that it would be a bit frustrating to drive back to Akureyi that day and then back east again to continue the ring road  the next day. However, I've heard that Myvatn itself is not really worth staying in, and I like the idea of being in a place for two nights.

3. April 19/20 are a bit light on activities - maybe that's OK, I don't mind some slower days but maybe there is something worth doing that I'm missing. or combine these days into one long driving day and cut the hotel in Seydisfjordur**?**

4. Should i leave a whole day for the Westman Islands? I could probably add one more day onto this itinerary, though it would hurt a bit because... budget

Post,June trip,Chloe102,2025-02-10 06:49:39,"Hello Iceland fans! My spouse and I just booked our flights for Iceland for mid June. We are active, outdoorsy people who love to explore. Some of our ideas have been snorkeling, going to lesser known thermal lagoons, lava tube tour, diamond beach and possibly a boat trip to see puffins. I’ve been doing lots of research on places to go and our ultimate debate is a sleeper van vs renting a car and staying at hotels. Any pros and cons on both? Any fun tips or ideas on things to do?

Post,Reykjavik City Card,scrambledlegsnh,2025-02-10 04:38:02,"I’m visiting Reykjavik in June and was looking at the Reykjavik City Card. It offers discounts for a few things I was planning on doing (Perlan, Elding Whale/Puffin watching). I was planning on pre-purchasing admission for these as I know June is busy tourist season. Does anyone know if it is possible to buy a ticket online using the City Card discount (especially if the card isn’t activated yet but will be on the day of the use)? Everything I see just says that you show the card when purchasing the ticket to get the discount, but Perlan and Elding both recommend booking online ahead of time.

Post,Cruise stops and 2 additional days in Iceland mid-late August,littleadventures,2025-02-09 04:25:23,"I’m going on a cruise in mid-late August with stops in Iceland, including two ports of call: Akureyri (9 AM to 9 PM) and Ísafjörður (9 AM to 6 PM). After the cruise, we’ll stay for two additional full days in Iceland.

I’ve been to Iceland once before and visited the Ring Road (including Akureyri), Golden Circle, and Snæfellsnes Peninsula, but it will be my mom’s first visit. I’d like to balance my familiarity with Iceland and her first-time experience.

My mom is a senior who used to hike a lot but recently has some knee pain. She can comfortably walk for 35-45 minutes and seems to be improving daily, but longer or strenuous hikes might not work. We may have to see when we get there. For good viewpoints or activities that don’t require much walking, I’d love recommendations.

For the two ports of call (Akureyri and Ísafjörður):

Are there must-see highlights near these locations? I’ve been to Akureyri before and open to ideas but prefer to be outside if the weather allows and less interested in museums.

Would horse riding or puffin viewing be recommended in these areas?

Should we spend time exploring the towns or focus on nearby nature instead?

For the two days after the cruise, I’m thinking the south coast. does this itinerary sound reasonable?

[Edit: apologies for the formatting. I’m on mobile]

Day 1: 
Drive from Reykjavík,
Seljalandsfoss (I’ve been before),
Gljúfrabúi,
Skógafoss (I’ve been before),
Svartifoss (Should we skip? I think it’s a 60-90 minute walk/hike?),
Dyrhólaey (puffins),
Reynisfjara (I’ve been before),
Stay overnight in Vik

Day 2:
Vík i Myrdal Church (Víkurkirkja),
Svínafellsjökull Viewpoint,
Fjallsárlón,
Jökulsárlón zodiac tour (I’ve been before),
Diamond Beach (I’ve been before),
Höfn (Probably skip since is another hour further from Jökulsárlón and would be the furthest east we go. I’ve had amazing langoustine at Pakkhús Restaurant but don’t know if we’ll have time),
Drive back to Reykjavík via Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon (60 min walk/hike),
End the day with a hot spring (not necessarily Blue Lagoon—thinking Sky Lagoon or Secret Lagoon)

Does this itinerary sound manageable? Would you suggest skipping or adding anything to make it better? Should I consider another region entirely instead of south coast? I thought south coast was my favorite area last time. ",1,2.0

Post,Puffins in late April,LtheDutch,2025-02-08 01:44:00,"I'm hoping to come to Iceland this April with my teen daughter, on a 2-3 day layover flight. She really wants to see puffins. This page has been very helpful with research and planning - and it sounds like puffins will probably be back in Iceland by the time of our visit. 
All the tours that I'm finding online start taking reservations for May 1st - does anyone know if it's possible to book a puffin tour before that, and which tour operator might be the best to talk to about that ?

 For reference, we will hopefully be there April 22-24.",4,4.0
Comment,,PolarBearEnt,2025-02-08 06:48:47,"Puffin season is generally from early May to end of August. You could do a Whale Watching tour from Reykjavik with a RIB boat, they'll most likely pass by the puffin island, and if the puffins have arrived early then you may see them. I'd recommend the tour with Elding.is, called premium whale watching from Reykjavik. 

A guaranteed way to see puffins would be to do a day trip to the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar), and go to the beluga whale and puffin sanctuary.

Comment,,Just-Replacement8284,2025-02-08 01:53:31,"It's not likely at all that there will be either tours or puffins at that time.  Tour operate by giving the customers what they are paying for and the little critters are still thinking about their trip to Iceland at this time of year... 

Best time is June-August...",1,
Comment,,goodie1663,2025-02-08 16:46:52,"My guess is that most of the operators do those dates because they can pretty much count on having puffins then, and it's not worth offering dates where they have to cancel. 

I was there the third week in August, and the tour operator had to cancel all tours on the day I booked because of bad weather. When they called me, they suggested doing the first tour of the day the next day because generally the weather was better then, so that's what I did. 

I very much enjoyed it, but we only saw maybe twenty total or so. The guide said that they were going to cancel all tours after that day and give refunds because the puffins had clearly decided that it was time to leave. 

I did see more of them later in several other locations, but you truly never know. Weather is also a factor.",1,
Comment,,LtheDutch,2025-02-08 02:27:48,"I appreciate this. It had seemed from my research that they tended to come back mid-April, but I didn't know if it was even worth trying to find someone to take us.  Thank you.",2,

I feel like I have planned a waterfall trip. I have waterfalls everywhere, which is fine because waterfalls are awesome. Do you recommend looking into anything more cultural? Volcano? Glacier? Kayaking?

Also, part of me really loves the idea of Hornstridir, is that worth the price and time commitment and removing everything east of Reykjavik? I feel like If I did that, I would do everything north and west instead of south and east. Would love any thoughts on that. Maybe I am just in love with one image of the cliffs and the foxes.

Comment,,PolarBearEnt,2025-02-07 07:25:08,"A few additions I'd recommend!

On arrival day, you can book the evening Lava Show in Vík, great introduction to Iceland's geology and volcanic history, education and entertaining experience. 

In the Jökulsárlón area, you could do the zodiac tour on Fjallsárlón (better than the one on Jökulsárlón), or a glacier hike, to get an upclose experience with the glaciers.

In the Westman islands, the RIB safari is a great way to see the coastline and puffins, as well as learn some history about the islands.

In the Golden Circle, having lunch at Friđheimar is a must-do! You could also try the Hrunalaug hot spring, very cheap hot spring experience, the land owners prevent too many people from entering at once so it is not overly crowded. 

Final day in Reykjavik, maybe do the free walking tour, will give you a chance to ask a local some questions about Iceland which you may have thought of during your visit, also its a nice introduction to the city.",2,

Comment,,outsideleyla,2025-02-06 20:43:23,"Your itinerary looks pretty good, but here are some important points: 

\-The Fimms trail is no joke. Most people take the bus to Thorsmork, then hike their way back toward Skogafoss. I would suggest doing it that way so you're always making your way back toward Vik, rather than possibly getting stuck. You MUST have a good weather day to do this hike. With only 6 days, you'd have to make smart decisions on whether to turn back/complete the hike. Make sure to have plenty of emergency food/water/etc. 

\-July 30 - you want to spend the night in the Skaftafell area. Either Hotel Skaftafell, Fosshotel, or a guest house. 

\-July 31 - there are lots of great hikes in the Skaftafell area. Go to visitor center and get their map of hiking trails. If you want to do Fimms I think you'd enjoy Skaftafell/Vatnajokull area a lot. 

\-Careful on your last day; if your flight departs at 7:55 PM, note that you want to be there at least 2 hours in advance because it can be a cluster getting everyone on the planes. For some reasons, departures are very chaotic at Keflavík.

Puffins can be found at Vik on the cliffs on the peninsula!",1,

Post,Opinion - April,SunnyD405OKC,2025-02-06 05:37:42,"Iceland Itinerary Overview
	•	Day 1: Arrive → Blue Lagoon → Dinner at Dill → Stay at The Reykjavík EDITION

OR
Option B: Return to Reykjavík for 2 nights of relaxation and city exploration

My Thoughts:

I originally planned to visit the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, but I’m questioning if it’s worth the long drive in April without the lush green landscapes that make it shine in late spring and summer. I’m sure it’s still stunning, but maybe less dramatic compared to peak seasons—and it’s quite a drive!

At the same time, Reykjavík doesn’t seem to get much hype for extended stays beyond a day or two, so I’m torn. Do I venture out for rugged coastal scenery or enjoy 48 hours of relaxed city vibes to end the trip?

I suppose we could always do the peninsula as a day trip from Reykjavik if we have the steam left at the end of the trip. We aren’t much for sitting around but I’m also concerned that a waterfall is a waterfall is a waterfall.  Adding some variety is probably helpful to not get overly accustomed to the beauty.

Also, I’d be willing to travel/stay for puffins!  I understand there a chance of seeing them in the Westman Islands pre-Easter? (Argument for more time near Hotel Ranga.)

Help me decide…. Day 5-6… we are self driving but I’m not against hiring a guide for a day. ",1,4.0

What are the odds of seeing a puffing mid-April ? Is there anywhere around the Island where it would be easier to try to find them ?

Thank you",1,2.0
Comment,,basedrifter,2025-02-04 02:07:11,"If you’re doing the ring then Borgarfjörður eystri will be easier and quicker to get to. Látrabjarg is quite far out of the way unless you’re spending a few days exploring the rest of the westfjords.

If the puffins haven’t arrived yet, it’s much less of a time commitment.",1,

Ill be renting a car and driving solo. I dont have an issue driving for a few hours at a time. I have 2 potential itinerary's. The first is split because I was planning on staying on the Westman Islands, but am not sure if thats a good idea or if I would just be losing time. The 2nd is to do the peninsula first before taking on the south coast. Thanks!

Post,"10 Nights/ 11 Days in Iceland, July. Seeking feedback on itinerary, takk!",Sharp_Round9642,2025-02-01 04:36:04,"Hae! Thank you to everyone on this sub for such a wealth of info! Using this, Google Maps, Lonely Planet, I've put together a 10 night / 11 day itinerary in early July for our family of 4, with two teen girls (12 and 15 yo).

Post,"Visiting April 20-27, 2025 with 2 teens",pattiprissypants,2025-01-30 19:28:30,"Hi, I am looking for suggestions on fun things for teens, not laser tag/ziplines, etc.  No challenging hikes. 

I have the following ideas:

* Lava show in Vik
* Langjokull Cave (tour suggestions recommended) instead of Thingvellir 
* Puffin tours
* I would also like to show them some cool volcano areas I may be missing.
* Football game.  I have done some research and either there are no games or I am looking in the wrong places. I tried **Stubbur.  Any other sports you would recommend that would be fun for a 15 yo boy?**
* Thermal spa. not Sky or Blue Lagoon

**Any suggestions welcome**

Itinerary is:

Arrive 21st, 5 am, rent car, and stay in Reykjavik until 23rd.  The Kids love cities, **suggestions on what to do there**

23rd Thingvellir national park, Kerid crater lake, Seljalandsfoss waterfall, possible Gljufrafoss waterfall, possibly Fontana Thermal Spa

24th - Skalabrekkufoss waterfall, Visit Reynisfjara Beach. **Suggestions for other things to do in town Vik and restaurants**

25th - Skaftafell Glacier, Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon or other glacier I can take them to without a tour or difficult hike.

26th Selfoss Skyrland, drive to Reykjanesfolkvangur nature preserve, stay in Keflavik

I thought it would make sense and be most efficient to leave from Reykjavik in the morning, do the Golden Circle, visit Secret Lagoon, and stay in Landeyjahöfn. **Is there a hotel you recommend?**

Then wake up there, take the ferry (without our car, probably), see the puffins and the museum (do you recommend a guided tour?), and drive back to Reykjavik in the late afternoon to get back in time for dinner.

Post,Our Iceland Ring Road and Westfjords Trip of 3 weeks (MAY/JUNE),Natural-Amazement,2025-01-25 09:20:06,"Our Iceland Ring Road and Westfjords trip we did in 3 weeks time is finally here and hopefully you will get inspired to visit this wonderful country at least once in your lifetime. It is already well over a year ago, but because of questions I still get about other posts I made here, I decided to make 1 big post and movie that has got it all.

You can watch my full 80 minute video here: [https://youtu.be/HRAzX8Fb2vM](https://youtu.be/HRAzX8Fb2vM)

With almost 100 places we visited in 3 weeks, this video will give you a good idea of how we experienced our time in Iceland. You will see epic waterfalls, gorgeous canyons, scenic landscapes, hazardous roads and of course some Icy experiences...

We went in May and June to increase our chances to see as much of Iceland as possible without being in the absolute peak season of tourists.

The weather was very Icelandic, which means we regularly had 4 seasons in 1 day: blue skies, hailstorms, severe winds, brights sunshine and heavy rains is what you can expect here, which creates a landscape that often feels out of this world and is nothing like I ever experienced before.

Although the whole country was one big highlight for me, some of my personal favorites where: Katla Ice Cave, Jökulsárlon Glacier Lagoon, Stuðlagil Canyon, Stapavík and the Svalvogar Circle (guided tour) in the Westfjords.

At every place we stopped, I felt like we could spend an extra day (or more) hiking and just enjoying the moment. We went 3 weeks and our itinerary was planned to not be rushed and to really have the time to let each moment sink in. We were with 4 people in one car.

In the video, you will see which day we are at in the bottom right of the screen. At the top left, you will regularly see the distance and time traveled between 2 places when we where on the road. If you need more specific information on time/distance between places, please let me know!

While it is already well over a year ago, it still feels like yesterday and gets me craving to go back every time I watch this video. And we will go back, that's for sure!

You will find the itinerary below here. For specific Timestamps of the video, please see the video description on youtube to skip to the part of your interest.

If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment, (either here or on youtube, I will check both comment sections to see if I can give some tips where I can).

Putting this video together took a long time, so if you like it, please share it and subscribe to my channel by clicking this link: [https://www.youtube.com/@Natural-Amazement?sub\_confirmation=1](https://www.youtube.com/@Natural-Amazement?sub_confirmation=1)

I sincerely hope to help some of you out by sharing this. A good preparation is key for this beautiful country.

Post,Suggestions/tips about visit in August,Bright-Psychology808,2025-01-17 21:40:25,"Hello everybody,

it's my turn to ask help for itinerary :)

I am planning my 3rd visit to Iceland for this summer. During my 1st time (summer) 2 years ago I visited Golden Circle, Reykjanes peninsula, south coast, Snaefelness and Thorsmork. On my 2nd time I did Golden circle and south coast only as it was during winter.

For my 3rd visit I finally want to drive the whole ring road. I can allocate 10 full days (not counting the day I fly in and I fly out) which most likely will be August 9-18. I'll focus more on the East and the North as I haven't seen them before, however I still want to include a couple days again in the south (as I like photography and as this will be my 1st time in Iceland alone, I can take my time to find good shots that I want) and Snaefellness (I loved that area during my 1st visit, I want to spend some time there again), adding a few new spots that I haven't visited before in those areas as well. However I'll skip the GC.

Another item on my agenda is - hopefully - to see puffins.

I'll be camping so locations of my overnight stays will be very flexible, as I won't need to book anything in advance.

I came up with a first raw itinerary, but still struggling with some choices therefore asking some help. This is what I was thinking:

**DAY 0: Arrival, car pick up**

**DAY 1: Reykjavik – Vik or Kirkjubaejarklaustur**

Possible stops: Seljalandfoss, Skogafoss, Dyrholaey, Reynisfjara, Eldhraun lava fields

**DAY 2: Kirkjubaejarklaustur - Hofn**

Possible stops: Fjadrargljulfur, Svinafellsjokull, Skaftafell/Svartifoss, Hofskirkja, Jokusarlon. Sleep near Hofn

**DAY 3: Hofn - Seydisfjordur**

Possible stops: Stokness & Vestrahorn, Eystrahorn, Djupivogur, Egilsstadir, Seydisfjordur (sleep here)

**DAY 4: Around Egilsstadir**

Possible stops: Hengifoss & Litlanesfoss, Borgafjordur Estri for puffins, sleep around Egilsstadir

**DAY 5 Egilsstadir - Myvatn**

Possible stops: Studlagil canyon, Dettifoss, (Hljodaklettar - I would be curious to check this one but looks a bit far. Probably not doable), Asbyrgi, sleep near Myvatn

**DAY 6 – Around Myvatn**

Possible stops: Hverarond, Krafla, Leirhnjukur, Grjotagja, Hverfjall, Dimmuborgir, Myvatn – sleep near Myvatn (or on the way to Godafoss)

**DAY 7: Myvatn – Hofsos**

Possible stops: Godafoss, Akureyri, Siglufjordur, Hofsos, sleep nearby

**DAY 8:  Hofsos** **– Hvammstangi**

Possible stops: Glaumbaer turf houses, Kalfhamarsvik, Hvitserkur, sleep near Hvammstangi

**DAY 9: Hvammstangi – Snaefellsness**

Possible stops: Berserkjahraun, Kirkjufell, Svodufoss, Ingjaldsholskirkja, Skardsvik, sleep somewhere on the peninsula.

**DAY 10 Snaefellsness – Reykjavik**

Possible stops: Djupalonssandur, Malarrif, Arnastapi & Hellnar, Budir and Budahraun, Ytri Tunga, drive to Reykjavik

**DAY 11 Bye bye Iceland** (see you again)

  
Now, the itinerary as it is it involves a reasonable amount of driving to me (during my 1^(st) visit in summer I quite enjoyed driving there, even for 250/300 km), however I have some doubts especially on the 2nd part:

\- Day 7/8 - Is the detour to Trollaskagi peninsula worth it? Siglufjordur looks very nice to me but I wonder if I should use this all amount of driving somewhere else.

\- Day 8/9 - Partially related, but the whole drive from Trollaskagi to Snaefellness looks like without much to see. Would you arrange this part somehow differently? Anything else you recommend to see/skip?

\- Puffins: I read that mid-august may be already a bit late but I hope I can still see them. Apart from Dyrholaey where I'll go anyway, I have basically allocated entire day 4 for Borgafjordur Estri which I read is one of the best spots to see puffins. Is this long detour worth it, considering also the time of the year? Or I should better try to add a day at Westman islands instead? (however I read Borgafjordur Estri is better for watching puffins closer - which may be better for photography.)

\- In general the main other places that I was considering for possible detours were Westman islands or even Kerlingarfjoll (renting 4wd of course), however I may need to allocate at least 1.5 days for either of the two, so I would need to cut somewhere else - not totally sure at the moment. 

\- I'll probably save other places like the Westfjords and Landmannalaugar for my 4th future visit :)

Would love to hear any suggestion or tips! Obviously my itinerary will remain flexible till the end, but I like to start dreaming about the trip from now :D  

Thanks a lot!

Slow down. It's no use going to a lot of places if you barely remember it.",2,
Comment,,highlanderfil,2025-01-17 21:55:03,"Your first day looks pretty packed. I'm not saying you can't do it (especially if you can sleep on planes), but you'll be exhausted at the end of it. We did a similar drive with barely any stops last August (our first hotel was in Kirkjubaejarklaustur) and I had to pull off at the top of the hill above Hveragerdi to take a cat nap so that I didn't drive off the road. Otherwise, it looks like a reasonable itinerary.

Re puffins: we've been two Augusts in a row and there were puffins on Dyrholaey both years. However, someone had pointed out to me that in 2022 puffins were gone from there by the third week of August.",1,
Comment,,dialabitch,2025-01-18 05:03:10,"Everyone goes Hofn-Egilsstadir, but I would suggest staying a night near Djupivogur or one of the small villages in the adjacent fjords, and one night in Borgarfjörður Eystri instead. The lower Eastfjords are so serene and unique. Seydisfjordur is definitely a great place to visit and stay too, but Borgarfjörður Eystri is truly mind-blowing. You’d beat the crowds to the puffins too which would be great.",1,
Comment,,IsakValerian,2025-01-20 07:37:30,Seems to be too much driving for 10 days. Puffins are likely to be away in August. In case you don't know their population dropped by 70%.,1,

I actually come from Italy so it won't be an overnight flight - I will be arriving the day before and sleep, before starting driving on the day 1.


As for puffins, what you say sounds promising!",1,
Comment,,dialabitch,2025-01-18 05:15:40,"Just wanted to add that I think you will be OK on your dates for puffins in both locations, but definitely also go to the Westman Islands if you can. Super worth it to go there for the scenery and history alone.",1,
Comment,,Bright-Psychology808,2025-01-20 17:42:04,"About driving: maybe, maybe not :) what I mean is, during my first visit in iceland, there were some days I could drive 300km and not even realising it.. just love watching the scenery keeps changing. In any case I can see how it goes and if it feels too packed I can always cut snaefellness from the end, as I already saw it once.


About puffins.. I didn't know about their population drop. I hope they'll still be there!",1,
Comment,,BionicGreek,2025-01-17 22:57:01,"Campers and tents have the same spots. It’s electric hookups you may be thinking. So yes you may need reservations.

Post,My trip during monsoon season!,Beautiful-Lettuce425,2025-01-17 17:18:32,"(I’m kidding…. Kind of 🤣)

This trip was absolutely life changing and I’m here to tell you that whatever you have to sacrifice to make it to Iceland is 10000% worth it. I started planning a second trip before I even left.

Details below!

The weather was absolutely HEINOUS (rained heavily every single day, had almost 100% cloud coverage, 60+ mph winds) and although it was unfortunate for obvious reasons, being the ONLY people at some of the most popular sights in Iceland was something I’ll never be able to experience again. The wind was so strong at kirkjufell I was sliding across the ice putting my spikes on and I would 100% do it again to be the only person there. We also got to essentially watch the seasons change, and see all the melted ice turn blue. 

Itinerary
Day 1
Dogsledding at Iceland HQ (expensive but unforgettable, heavy snow and low visibility and it just looked absolutely surreal)
Phallogical Museum

Day 2
Kirkjufell (hiked, only people there)
Arnarstapi (walked around the cliffs)
Snaefellus Penninsula/ Hellissandur (drove, favorite view of the trip)
Budak (church/trails and glacier viewpoint, only people there)

Day 3
Reynisfjara (first people there)
(Ice cave tour was cancelled)
Fjaðrárgljúfur (hiked, only people there)

Day 4
Gullfoss
Geysir 
Thingvellir (oxarafoss was my favorite view of the trip)
Explored downtown Reykjavík 

Day 5
Langihryggur (tried to hike, weather kicked my ass, ate shit in the mud, ended up with a swamp inside my boots 🤣 ended up leaving and driving around Grindavik area/mossy lava rocks)
Antiksalan & Antikbudan
Sky Lagoon

Day 6
Kerid Crater
Seljalandsfoss Waterfall
Katla Ice Cave Tour (100000% worth the money)

Day 7
Blue Lagoon

Bars
Lemmy 
Prikid 

Restaurants 
Freidheimer
Deig 
Himalayan Spice
Ramen Momo
Black Crust Pizzeria

Things I would do differently
I wouldn’t stay in Reykjavík the whole time. It was super convenient to have a home base but I think I could’ve done more if I stayed northwest the first half and toward Vik the second half. It also made it difficult to see the aurora, since we would’ve had to get in the car and drive out the city if it decided to show up late in the night. That being said, driving around for 4-6 hours a day really let us see A LOT of the land and some of my favorite sights I just happened to drive by. 

I wanted to try the food since it was my first time there, but as a vegan it was extremely disappointing (I know I know, I expected it to be.) There was an option almost everywhere we went which is awesome but most of it was just not good. I would for sure just hit the grocery store for sandwiches and what not next time.

Price Breakdown for Two (approx)
$750 flights/baggage (PLAY SWF-KEF)
$884 hotel for 7 nights (paid an extra day so we could check in at 6am, Marina Reykjavík)
$324 rental car (free insurance with CC, ACE)
$400 gas 
$750 food snacks groceries
$450 drinks
$1200 guided tours(dog sledding, Katla tour)/lagoons
$300 souvenirs
$100 parking

After my CC points (~$1200) it was about $4000 EVERYTHING included for two of us for seven days. After doing the ‘once in a lifetime’ things and learning the food situation it could be done for at least $1500 less.




Things to do next time!

Post,Help with August 2025 itinerary. ,Iliketrees7777,2025-01-14 08:44:15,"Hi all, 

I've never been to Iceland before. I am planning a two-week trip from roughly August 15-30 (give or take a day or two). Could you give me some feedback on the itinerary (primarily after day 8)? The two most important things to me are seeing the highlands (i.e., the trek) and seeing puffins on the Westman Islands.  Based on other feedback I’ve read here, I don’t think I would enjoy trying to do the entire Ring Road in between days 8-14 and so I’d rather focus on a smaller part of the county in more depth. But there are some days where I'm worried I'm taking it TOO slow (specific questions below). 

Day 1 – Fly into to Reykjavik in the morning, explore the city, maybe Sky Lagoon.

Days 2-7 – Laugavegur & Fimmvörðuháls Trek through Artic Adventures, back in Reykjavik in the evening of Day 7, stay in Reykjavik.  

Day 8 – Sleep somewhat late (due to six prior days of hiking and sleeping in huts), pick up rental car, drive to Landeyjahöfn, take afternoon/evening ferry to Westman islands. Sleep on Heimaey. **\[Is it worth trying to squeeze in some part of the Golden Circle on this day or is that too much?\]**

Day 9 – Puffin tour, either stay in Heimaey again or take the evening ferry out and stay in Vik. **\[Is two nights in Heimaey worth it for maximum puffin opportunity or is Vik preferable?\]** 

Day 10 –Skaftafell/Svartifoss, black sand beach, etc., stay near near Jökulsárlón.

Day 11 – Diamond Beach, glacier kayaking tour. Stay near Jökulsárlón again **\[Is this too much time in the Jökulsárlón area?\]**

Day 12 – Glacier hike or do some longer hikes in between Jökulsárlón and Höfn, Stay in Höfn.

Day 13  – Drive to Stokknes then drive back to Reykjavik (6 hours), stopping to see anything I missed on previous days. Stay in Reykjavik. 

Day 14 – Chill at Hvammsvik Hot Springs and lazily see some sights on the way there and back. Stay in Reykjavik or maybe in an airport hotel. \[**Is there a better way to use this day?**\]

Day 15 – fly out in the morning

Since the kiddo is only ok for car trips a few hours max at a time, we’ve decided to stake out 3 main “home bases” to see things from:

3 days near Skaftafell for the National park
3 days in Seyðisfjörður for the fjords and puffins
1 day in Höfn as rest stop back southwest
3 days in Laugarvatn for the golden circle

Post,Trip Report – August 2023 Snaefellsnes,m3lonmama,2025-01-13 02:14:47,"We (two older adults and our twenty-something children) went to Iceland mid-August 2023.  We had six full days (including an early arrival on day 1) and about half a day on our last day in Iceland.  We toured the Snaefellsnes peninsula, Thingvellir, and the south coast as far as Jokulsarlon, with the last half day spent in Reykjavik.  Accommodations included guest houses, Airbnb’s and hotels. Excursions included horseback riding, Thorsmark SuperJeep Day Tour with Midguard (trip highlight), Glacier Adventure with Melrakki, and Fjallsarlon lagoon rib boat tour (the “kids” did the glacier adventure while my husband and I did the rib boat tour).  For our spa lagoon experience we went to Krauma.  We loved and would recommend everything we did.                

 Since so much is written about the south coast I thought I’d highlight Snaefellsnes.  The day and a half we had in this area we had the worst weather of our trip - alternating drizzle, rain, and high winds.  We wore our waterproof gear and just kept going, as did others we met along the way.

 \-        Kirkjufellfoss (photo 1) – When we arrived at the parking lot for Kirkjufellsfoss, the wind was raging.  To get to the spot to take the iconic picture of the waterfall and the mountain, you have to go across a bridge and then walk across the spine of a hill.  We could barely stand up to walk across the bridge; no way we were going out on that narrow path!  I’m happy with my photo although it’s not the one I had planned on.   I still smile when I think about laughing with all the other tourists at how idiotic it was that we’d even gotten out of our cars.  Unpopular opinion – a lot of people go quite a distance out of their way to get this photo.  If you are limited in time, I would only prioritize this if it was along my route. 

\-        Djupalonssandur (photos 2,3,4) – we chose to go to this beach instead of Reynisfjara so that we could have the black sand beach experience without the crowds.  There is a short hike to get to the beach, then there’s the wreckage of a trawler, the stones you can use to prove your strength, and finally the beach itself, which is beautiful to explore.  I can’t say how it compares to Reynisfjara since we didn’t stop there but we really enjoyed this area.  In general, if you’re worried about crowds, I would look for alternatives to some of the “top ten” spots.  Dramatic beauty abounds.

\-        Londranger (5) – this is a quick stop with a view point which resulted in one of the best photos I took in Iceland.  If we’d had more time, there was a path that looked interesting which would have made this a more rewarding stop but it was worth it for the photo. 

\-        Arnarstapi (6,7) – there were no seals at Ytri Tunga when we stopped there but we did see a couple at Arnarstapi.  This was a beautiful area and we enjoyed walking the path partway to Hellnar – we had hoped to go the whole way but we did not really have time and the rainy day was not ideal for this.  A lot of birds make their homes in the cliffs here (although it’s not the place for puffins).   

\-        Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge(8,9) – We had planned to skip this but stopped on spur of the moment and it was one of our favorite things that we did.  We didn’t go very far inside as it was slippery with all the rain but just walking up to that looming cliff, getting closer and closer, then creeping inside – we were in awe.  My photos don't do justice to this amazing site.

\-        Budarkirkje (black church)(10) – It’s black.  And it’s a church.  I don’t get it but there is a path I would have loved to have had time to follow.  I believe I read that it leads to another beautiful black sand beach. 

\-        We also made quick stops at Gerduberg Cliffs and Sheep’s Waterfall aka Selvallafoss (apparently you can walk behind this waterfall but it was too slippery when we were there), and drove through Berserkjahraun lava field.  We unfortunately didn’t have time to see Svardsvik (golden sand) beach or Svortuloft Lighthouse, or to climb Saxholl Crater, or to see any of the myriad other things that don’t make anyone’s blog.  

\-        We had our best meal of the trip at Bjargarsteinn Mathus in Grundarfjordur.  This restaurant is absolutely charming, the food is amazing and very local, and you have a view of Kirkjufell.  In high season, reservations are a must as the restaurant is tiny and we saw several people turned away.

\-        Last two photos are of Krauma.

 By now you see why they call Snaelsfellsness, “Iceland in Miniature”.  You probably also saw a recurring theme… we didn’t have enough time.  I know people do the ring road in five days but for me, some of the side paths we DID make time for were my favorite parts of the trip as there was such a sense of exploration and discovery.   If I had it to do over again, I’d either add a day or two to the trip or cover less territory.  Also, many sights, like Kirkjufellsfoss, require a short hike and careful footwork as you get closer, which feels a bit precarious if it’s windy.  Just keep that in mind when you are thinking about the impact of weather on your trip.

Thanks for reading.  I’m happy to answer any questions.

If you’ve read this far, thank you! We were told that with 16 days, we should head to the Westfjords. But what I’ve researched is that you need 3-4 days for the Westfjords and that would really condense our Ring Road itinerary. We’re also travelling with elementary school aged kids so we don’t want to go at a pace where they’ve checked out on day 5 from exhaustion.  

Anything I’ve missed, you would add or remove from the itinerary? ",1,8.0

Comment,,Ikura87,2025-01-11 23:45:40,"This is a good outline.  It's super jamb-packed, and don't feel bad about slowing down a bit at the places you are most excited about and maybe skipping some others as a day of decision.  If the puffins are still around, you should see them in the Westman Islands and Dyhrolaey.   There is a captive one that lives in the Whale Sanctuary, so that was our puffin experience in late September. 

We loved the Westman Islands, and if you can stay the night there and catch an early boat back, you'll save some backtracking.   Gott was good for dinner.

The Troll Peninsula drive is great and highly recommended.

Post,Any advice on my 8 day ring road trip? ,FieryTaco123,2025-01-07 07:15:48,"We have 9 days and 8 nights for our upcoming trip end of May. We’re not big hikers and are more about driving to enjoy scenery and stopping for nice photo ops. We are both two young adults, active. 

Our rough itinerary is (and I know this is busy, it’s sort of how we travel):

Day 1 - Reykjavik and Blue Lagoon

Day 2 - Thingvillir

Day 3 - Vik, Black Sand Beach, Skogafoss, Kvernufoss, Katla Ice Cave, Skalakot Manor

Day 4 - Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon, Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon tour, Diamond Beach, Pakkhus

Day 5 - Drive to Seydisfjordur (stay overnight) and then see puffins at Borgarfjarðarhöfn, maybe fit in Vok Baths

Day 6 - Drive to Stuðlagil Canyon, Dettifoss, Lake Myvatn, Vogafjós Farm for lunch, then go to Akureyi and stay for night, maybe do Forest Lagoon at night

Day 7 - Explore Akureyi then drive to Snæfellsnes Peninsula, check into Hotel Budir in late afternoon

Day 8 - Relax around Hotel Budir, then drive to Reykjavik for dinner, maybe OX or Dill, Sky lagoon? before early flight out 

Day 9 - 10 AM flight 


Should we keep Snæfellsnes with this itinerary? I’ve heard good things re Hotel Budir. Also I know we’re not big hikers but I’m not 100% sure how much time to allocate for Stuðlagil Canyon or Lake Myvatn sight s. 

We only really have to be back in Reykjavik for dinner before our 10 AM flight - are there better areas to visit that are relaxing other than Snaefellsnes? It doesn’t seem like there’s much on the drive between Akureyi and Reykjavik. ",1,2.0

Post,Fix my agenda: Kids' 6th birthday in June,SadlyNotSpaceballs,2025-01-02 05:31:43,"Hae and happy new year!

I've been to Iceland twice (once solo and once with a buddy) doing Reykjavik, Golden Circle, Silfra snorkeling, Into the Volcano, Snaefellsness, South Coast, Katla, Skaftafell, Jokulsarlon. Never really saw the lights despite 10+ nights over two trips in winter, oh well.

In June, I'm coming back for 4 days this time with my family - wife and twin who will turn 6 our last full day there. Here's the  agenda I have so far. Curious if there's anything you'd change, or any special birthday thing I haven't thought of yet to add. (Also, hotel.) Thanks!

**Day 1 (1/2 Day)**

* Arrive at 3:30pm from Denmark. Rent car.
* Drive to Reykjavik. Explore and shop Laugavegur. Get a hot dog.
* Lava Show at night only planned activity
* Nice dinner. Ice cream from Loki Cafe. Rest.

**Day 2 - Reykjavik Fun**

* Just a few major sites for kids - church, sun voyager, Harpa
* Nexus for birthday present (buy something to do in car next two days)
* Perlan (1-2 hours)
* Lunch at Lebowski Bar
* 4pm - Raufarholshellir tour only time-planned activity
* FlyOver. Maybe Omnom chocolate factory tour if enough time.
* Dinner, rest. (I really want to try Reykjavik Kitchen or Kol... we'll see if kids can do it.)

**Day 3 - Adventure Day**

* 8:30am - Leave Reykjavik
* 9:30am - Kerid Crater until 10am
* 10:30am - Secret Lagoon until 12pm (is that long enough with almost 6-year-olds?)
* 12:30pm - Fridheimar for lunch until 1:30pm
* 2pm - Bruarfoss (I hear there's new parking close to entrance, good for kids) until 2:30pm
* 3pm - Geysir until 3:30pm
* 4pm - Gulfoss until 4:30pm
* 6pm - Back in Reykjavik for dinner and rest

**Day 4 - Birthday with Puffins**

* 8am - Leave Reykavik
* 10am - Arrive at Landeyjahöfn for 10:45am ferry
* 11:30am - Vestmannaeyjar
* **I have no idea yet about the puffin tour, museum, etc. or how long to spend**
* Kids won't have TONS of energy for walking around, should we take a car?
* I was thinking to leave on 17:00 ferry though I haven't researched it enough yet
* Drive back to Reykjavik
* Birthday dinner and cake if possible **(any suggestions where?)**

**Day 5 (1/2 day)**

* Cinnamon buns from Braud & Co or brunch at Laundromat
* Walk around, do some small things in Reykjavik we skipped above.
* One more hot dog and leave for airport at 1pm

**HOTEL CHOICE**

* I like Reykjavik Lights and appreciate the parking. I guess it will be harder to park in the city center in June though I think we'll manage to find a spot when we need to
* Should I consider Hotel Viking for the kids instead?

OK how did I do planning this one out so far? I don't want to over-pack the trip but I want the kids to see a lot, so trying to find a good balance. What do you think???

Post,Best wildlife viewing in early spring?,Lanky_Astronaut_2772,2025-01-01 19:22:28,"Currently building our itinerary for end of March to beginning of April (I know, cutting it close, I usually prefer to plan trips 6 months out). This was not the priority on selecting our dates but if there's a chance to see some critters I'd love to try to make it happen. 

We're definitely doing Reykjavik and Golden Circle/Southwest. Trying to decide between west or southeast for the remainder of our time (or a whirlwind of both). Probably not going to make it farther north than that on this trip but may come back someday, since I want to go again when I can see puffins and also do more intense hiking than my travel companion can handle or the weather can allow. 

Is there anywhere that would provide a good chance of some cool creatures given these dates? Birds, mammals, I love it all (particularly anything that would be unfamiliar to a Pacific Northwest audience - we probably won't go far out of our way to see orca since they essentially live in our backyard).

Post,Advice for short stay in June,Virtual-Depth-418,2025-01-01 00:30:40,"We're doing a short 2-day stopover on the way back from London to the US and have booked a 2-night stay at a hotel in/near Vik. This will be our second trip and the first time we went, we only made it as far as Vik.

Day 1: Land at KEF at 3:15pm and take a rental car to Vik. We wanted to visit some of the spots we really sped through last time (Skogafoss) and some places we missed last time (Dyrholaey Lighthouse) and maybe check out the Yoda Cave before heading back to the hotel. 

Day 2 is really the only full day we have since our flight will be the next day at 4:45pm. So, the plan was to visit the glacier lagoon + diamond beach and then hit some other highlights while driving back to Vik. 

Any places/experiences we should be sure to do in the way back from Jokulsarlon? We like to do things at our own pace and can't do as much hiking with the 6yo. I saw a 2.5 hr puffin tour but am debating whether it's worth the time/effort. We did a puffin boat tour last time and saw them from afar and my kids are ""eh"" about seeing them again.

We also weren't sure if we should save some things to do the day of our flight. I would rather not risk accidentally missing our flight, so our plan is to drive to KEF from our hotel in Vik and hit one or two locations before getting to the airport by 2 pm.

Thanks in advance!",2,2.0
Comment,,Guide-to-Iceland,2025-01-09 05:49:52,"For your full day exploring from Vik to Jökulsárlón, consider stopping at Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon on your way back. It's a stunning moss-covered canyon with easy viewing platforms, perfect for families with young children. The Skaftafell area of Vatnajökull National Park is also worth a visit, with short, family-friendly trails to waterfalls like Svartifoss. Given your limited time, I suggest skipping the puffin tour if your children aren't particularly excited about it. Instead, consider a quick stop at Fjallsárlón glacier lagoon - it's less crowded than Jökulsárlón but equally beautiful. On your way to the airport on your last day, if you have time for a stop, the Seljalandsfoss waterfall is right off the Ring Road, and you can walk behind it, which is always exciting. Alternatively, the Lava Centre in Hvolsvöllur offers interactive exhibits about Iceland's volcanoes that are great for all ages.

We only have 3 days. I'm debating whether it's worth dedicated a full day to Vestmannaeyjar vs. doing the short boat cruise for whales and puffins out of Reykjavik. Here's my (very tentative) agenda:

Wednesday: Arrive in late afternoon from Copenhagen. Rest and explore downtown Reykjavik. Shopping, dinner. Lava Show at night. Grab a hot dog.

Thursday: Golden Circle. Add Bruarfoss. Tomato restaurant maybe for lunch. Raufarhólshellir. Dinner.

Friday: Puffins. Here's my debate - do a full-day trip, or what I'm leaning to is doing the boat tour which would open things up for Perlan, FlyOver, Nexus, maybe Secret Lagoon. Anything else I'm missing that kids would love?

Saturday: Kids' 6th birthday! Anything special to do in morning other than cinnamon buns from Broadco? Fly home in late afternoon.

Thanks!",1,4.0

Post,Favorite Destinations to see in the North/East ,GoldAdministration59,2024-12-15 15:12:40,"Hi all! 
Iceland is calling me back, and I just booked an 8 day camper van trip for August of 2026
We only got to see the south west over to Vik on our very short trip, so I’m thinking we will focus our energy on the areas we didn’t get to hit last time. 

Here are a few of the things I’ve found and tentatively planned: 

- Diamond Beach & Jökulsárlón (this was my goal for the first trip and a broken down car kept us from getting there)
- Akureyri : Forest Lagoon, would love other suggestions for what to do 
- Látrabjarg cliffs to see the puffins 
-Snaefellsnes peninsula : general plan to be here for the eclipse
- Snæfellsjökul : hoping this is accessible without 4x4 car? 🫣


I wanted to ask all of you seasoned Iceland travelers and Icelanders what we should add to our itinerary! 
Also your favorite camp grounds that you stayed at or ones you’d avoid would be incredibly helpful 

note: I am mobility restricted (I faint with intense exercise) so easy to moderate hikes only (not entirely uphill) with overall hike time of less than 2.5 hours ideally. 

Thank you so much everyone!

we love being outdoors but also appreciate downtime (i.e. the accommodations matter to us), we generally dislike big, crowded, touristy activities, we love food and love to experience culture through food when possible. Also good to know that we rented a car.  
This is our rough itinerary. Would love thoughts on places to stop along the way, best food spots, alternative accommodations, tips, or if we should consider a slight change to the plans: 

Monday: arrive early am and stop at Kokulist bakery. Go to sky lagoon. After sky lagoon drive to Ion adventure hotel and relax. 
Tuesday: snorkel Silfra, explore Thingvellir park. Stay another night at Ion Adventure hotel. 
Wednesday: drive to either Hotel Umi or Hotel Kria (undecided). Leisurely drive and stop and see sights along the way. Explore beach/ do puffin tour if enough time/energy that day. 
Thursday: explore a little more and drive back to Reykjavik in afternoon. Stay at Edition. Thoughts on food? 
Friday: explore Reykjavik. actual anniversary and want to have diner at either Oto, Ox or Dill (undecided). Stay again at Edition. 
Saturday: hit Blue lagoon before airport (if open). If not, do more in Reykjavik.

Comment,,violinniloiv,2024-12-15 13:08:31,"If this is your 10-year anniversary, I'd ball out and try The Retreat Hotel at Blue Lagoon for at least the 2-night minimum before your flight out, which is already near the airport. If not, Silica Hotel and the Retreat Package/day pass are options, as is the Lava Cove which is almost like having your own room at The Retreat and costs a lot less.  It sounds like you are already contemplating Ox, which is nearly $1000 for 2 people (it's also not just 11 seats, I believe now it is 16 or 18) You can also at least do the Sker Package at Sky Lagoon with your own changing rooms since that's your first stop in the country after the bakery. I'd recommend doing the Ingolfshofdi Puffin Tour on the way to or from Vik, I saw 1000's of Puffins there. I am not sure I'd worry so much about the Glass Cottage thing if you aren't there during Northern Lights but if you are, near the ION Adventure Hotel you have the ""Iceland Lakeview Retreat"" which is also 2-night minimum. Most the other ones that are full glass in Hella or Borgarnes, at least Hella is sort of on the way to Vik and has way more privacy, there is not someone else right beside you. Though, the other ""Panoramic"" named ones often have a shared sauna in between. I posted my itinerary for 9 days in January just recently you can check out or let me know if you have any questions.


5 nights, stay in Reykjavik, day 2 is Golden Circle and stay in a Glass Cottage in either Hella or the one by Thingvellir, I'd recommend whichever you pick stay for at least 2-3 nights, then last 2 nights I'd try going over to Blue lagoon's Retreat and have anniversary dinner at Moss (michelin star)",3,

Post,Icelandic Christmas Traditions - The Yule Lads (Jólasveinarnir),misssplunker,2024-12-13 14:03:00,"Happy Friday!

Time for a little bit of Icelandic Christmas lore!

Today, when the Swedes celebrate [St. Lucia](https://sweden.se/culture/celebrations/lucia-in-sweden) by dressing in long, white gowns, wear a candle crown on their heads and bake lussekatter, Icelanders welcome the second of the jólasveinar (Yule Lads) to town - Giljagaur

Many might know that the Yule Lads are 13, arriving from the eve of the 12th of December, until the eve of the 24th (when Icelanders celebrate Christmas - called Aðfangadagur in Icelandic)

In olden times they were more troll-like, stealing, vandalizing and generally being a menace. They are the sons of Grýla and Leppalúði and their house cat is the infamous Jólaköttur (Yule Cat). 

There are a bunch more names for the Yule Lads, and in general the children of Grýla and Leppalúði, but the 13 ones we still anticipate were the ones mentioned in a poem by Jóhannes út Kötlum, called [Jólasveinarnir](https://notendur.snerpa.is/systaoggaui/jolasveinavisa.htm) in the book *Jólin koma* (a classic every Icelandic child must own). The book was published in 1932 and illustrated by Tryggvi Magnússon. The order of the Yule Lads is thus:

1. Stekkjarstaur
2. Giljagaur
3. Stúfur
4. Þvörusleikir
5. Pottaskefill
6. Askasleikir
7. Hurðaskellir
8. Skyrgámur
9. Bjúgnakrækir
10. Gluggagægir
11. Gáttaþefur
12. Ketkrókur
13. Kertasníkir

Their names correspond with one of their ""quirks"", each name indicates either what they like to steal or which prank they like to pull. [Arctic Adventures ](https://adventures.is/blog/the-icelandic-yule-lads/)has a good list of their translated names. 

In modern times, children put one shoe on their windowsill and each one of the Yule Lads brings a little gift each night (a clementine, some candy, small toys, art supplies or books) if they're good or a potato if they're naughty.

The tradition originated with Icelandic fishermen in the 20th century, who sailed in the North Sea and learned about children in the Netherlands putting a stocking up on December 6th. The trend began in the 1930s but didn't get widespread until the middle of the 20th century. In the 60s the tradition became more monolith, with children putting their shoe up on the 11th and the 13 Yule Lads arriving with small gifts

The modern Yule Lads are often associated with Brian Pilkington's illustrations, he has published some books about the Yule Lads but you can see some of his artwork on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=2a50764752e9bb1a&sxsrf=ADLYWIJIn-FXg9cdLeSoqEBQ5qJA1j0-3A:1734098413553&q=yule+lads+brian+pilkington&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0A6bwEop21ehxKWq5cj-cHaJa9t3BrdqzYzrlCn45Xx7cJPyv6ihpvNtDF4DasnrWhUSaR6wqzw3gWfSeKGMWLdDxz_CDdt2kS7hsFOegu6XT-2px37nI-ouvWSQMicayZkReuBr0Z2F2Wq4P-CN20441H6PyGz0LwqDYAH6mZfErB-bp4&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc3sf_86SKAxUz7rsIHdsgGlwQtKgLegQIERAB&biw=1536&bih=695&dpr=1.25). You can also find Christmas tree ornaments and figurines of his depiction of the Yule Lads in most puffin stores

There are many debates about where the Yule Lads live. In Reykjavík, most people believe they live in Esja. In the Mývatn area, they're believed to live in Dimmuborgir, and if you're in the area you can sometimes spot them: [https://www.jolasveinarniridimmuborgum.com/](https://www.jolasveinarniridimmuborgum.com/) . They're dressed rather traditionally there, but you might also be able to spot them in Árbæjarsafn tomorrow: [https://borgarsogusafn.is/vidburdir/bradum-koma-blessud-jolin-joladagskra614942](https://borgarsogusafn.is/vidburdir/bradum-koma-blessud-jolin-joladagskra614942)

There are many great articles online that go into further detail, if you're interested!

Maybe you can even try putting a shoe in the window to see if Stúfur will stop by your window tonight! ",31,8.0

When I planned my visit previously, I also wanted to see both Puffins and Northern Lights. But after some googling, I realised this is improbable. If you try to get both, chances are, you could miss both. So I chose Puffin. In terms of probability, if you arrive between May and Jul, you are almost certain to see Puffins. Just head to Borgarfjörður eystri and there are plenty of them. They are so close that you can almost touch them (though you definitely should not).",3,

Heimaey is a MUST ,ToiletFarm01,2024-12-07 21:35:09,"Been a few months since my trip to Iceland & I'm finally sitting down to go through the 2500+ photos & videos I have from my van trip around the country. I have to tell you all that one thing I HIGHLY recommend is the ferry from Landeyjahöfn for a day trip to Heimaey.  I went after the puffins left but i was there to hike Heimaklettur & see the Eldfell volcano and it was gorgeous. Very few people came out throughout the day since the earliest ferry was postponed due to wind & it stayed very windy all day. The only people I saw on my Heimaklettur hike were the workers at the fish processing facilities near the trailhead. Most people were probably smarter than my friends & I & opted to not scale the mountain in the wind. It was easy though. We didn't encounter any other tourists until we finished the hike up Eldfell volcano on the other side of the island.  Rode some Hopp scooters from the fish factories across town to Eldfell & stopped by a bakery en route for lunch.  Its up there for the highlight of my trip.

Any other puffin sites good for photography?

Comment,,hertziceland,2024-12-03 09:15:50,"You're right about Borgarfjörður Eystri; it’s a great choice and doesn’t involve F roads, so you’ll have a smooth drive. Staying overnight is a good idea to catch those early morning and late evening shots when the light is just perfect.

For the Westman Islands, if you can spare the time, I'd recommend staying the night rather than just doing a day trip. It gives you more flexibility to explore and photograph the puffins and the stunning landscapes there without rushing. Plus, the sunset and sunrise are spectacular!

You mentioned Dyrhólaey and Látrabjarg; indeed, puffins can be a bit far on the cliffs which might challenge photography without a good zoom lens. If you're looking for other sites where the puffins might be easier to photograph, consider places like Akurey, Stórhöfði in Vestmannaeyjar, and Tjörnes Peninsula near Húsavík for some fantastic opportunities.

We’ve gotten most of our research from this subreddit and come up with a rough daily breakdown of where we are going and where we are staying and would love it if y'all could provide some thoughts, feedback or advice!

Some context about us:

* We plan to alternate driving as fairly as possible
* We plan to rent some 4x4
* We plan to pack light and essentially find new accommodations each day as we drive around Ring Road
* We are fairly active and enjoy being outdoors
* We want to see as much as we can but don’t mind if we end up missing something we planned during a day
* Some days we would like to be more chill and some days we don’t mind not being chill at all, I guess having some balance is nice
* We are very excited to take in the views of Iceland and also see some Puffins

Questions we have:

* How realistic is our plan?
* Advice for adjusting to varying weather conditions (summer time)
* Really any advice y’all may have that would make this trip a better experience for us

Here is our daily breakdown and we have also attached an image of our route through Iceland:

Post,Itinerary help (Thank you!) - August 2025 // 17 days,T_alwaysonholiday,2024-10-17 18:04:48,"Hello!

I have spent the past few weeks working through the many reddit posts to pull together our two week itinerary. We're flying in from the UK and planning to rent a car. On the car - my understanding is we need a 4x4 due to the handful of F-roads involved on this trip - **is that correct?**

We're well travelled, in our 30s and not particularly budget conscious as this is a dream bucket list trip for us. We're big into food - from casual to fine dining and have included a restaurants I have found through this subreddit - but open to recommendations! We're up for hikes (think a couple of hours vs a day event) but are not avid or regularly hikers. We are reasonably fit and active and will of course pack correctly!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1 - Fly into Reykjavik mid-morning / afternoon  
Dinner at Skál!  
**We're in Reykjavik for two nights - does it make sense to get the car from the airport on day one OR have the two nights in Reykjavik without the car and get it the morning of Day 3 / end of Day 2?**

You deserve a PRIZE if you've got this far down the post!!

I don't thiiink we're packing in too much - but open to feedback! Would love input on other ideas where potentially we have quieter days or alternatives if better ideas out there.

Anything overrated / over hyped that would be better skipping?

I am very conscious we haven't made it to the Western Peninsula but I didn't want to rush it so will save it for another trip back one day.

Thank you all for your time and great content already on this subreddit!  
And I promise to pay this forward with a detailed trip report next year.",2,4.0
Post,My week in Iceland ,Starryeyedblond,2024-10-15 19:07:29,"I just got home yesterday from my week long trip in the majestic country of Iceland. It was absolutely amazing. We booked through a tour company and I’m glad we did. It was nice to have the guides tell us all of the history of each place we visited. We are planning to go back in the summer of 2026 to see the puffins and we will drive ourselves around. 

The black crust pizza in Vík was surprisingly delicious. I enjoyed staying in Reykjavik. We were close to downtown so walking was easy. 

I am obsessed with the trip and am finally seeing why everyone is bummed to have left! ",8,11.0
Post,Should I change my flights to September?,wegl13,2024-10-08 19:07:04,"I am going to admit, I think yalls pics the past couple of days RUINED me. I got super excited a week ago and bought tickets for June 8-20 of next year because there's a new, inexpensive nonstop from my home city. I have booked places to stay all around the Ring Road as well as snorkeling, horseback riding, and whale watching.

I picked June because I was hoping to decrease the risk of cold+rain (I have good clothes but man, I hate being both cold and wet), and wanted to see puffins and wildflowers. HOWEVER, the aurora pics are driving me nuts now, because I know the odds of seeing them are nil in June, and reading about how bad the crowds are from everyone's ""September is the best time to go"" posts are making me sad (even though I think our longer drive around the Ring Road will keep us mostly away from the absolutely packed crowds).

It's $500 to change flights. Can someone please tell me to stay with the June dates? It seems like if this goes well, a shorter return trip to just hunt the lights might be reasonable?",10,32.0
Comment,,icelandisaverb,2024-10-08 21:34:48,"I try to visit Iceland in both June and September each year, and they're both my favorite months for totally different reasons. June has puffins and wildflowers, as you mentioned, plus the midnight sun! And so much birdlife (I love the drumming sound Hrossagaukur/Snipes make as they fly through the air-- the first time I heard it I thought honestly thought it was a space alien).

Seeing the aurora can be awesome, but this past June we witnessed whales breaching under the midnight sun in Eyjafjörður outside of Akureyri, which was just as incredible. To me, Iceland is the land where amazing things can happen at any time, which is what makes it so magical in any season.",7,
Comment,,LePetitNeep,2024-10-08 20:14:45,"I went mid September, had very little rain, and saw no auroras. Kind of wished I could have seen puffins, pictures of them gave me FOMO. 

Theres always compromise.",2,
Comment,,Imaginary-Wallaby-37,2024-10-08 22:51:08,"Stay with your plan and see the Puffins.  Check out Aurora Basecamp when you are there.  Even if you don't see the lights, it's a great talk and campfires to sit around drinking coffee and cocoa with a free toilet all night long.",1,
Comment,,EvidenceFar2289,2024-10-09 01:17:02,"We just came back from 2 weeks in Iceland.  Yes we saw the Aurora multiple times but we also had to change our plans as it snowed in the north and our rental still had summer tires (It is illegal to use studded tires before November 1st).  Thank goodness we were able to re-arrange our accommodations.  Icelanders are extremely kind and understanding of driving concerns in the north.  We instead made it a thermal pool tour, did the south and added Vestmannaeyjar to our plans which we will never regret.  We did see puffins and beluga whales at the sanctuary on the island as well as learned about a large eruption on the island and a museum about the excavation of a home from that eruption.",1,
Comment,,MilumiGermany,2024-10-10 12:05:32,I hope you know that the aurora never looks like the pictures. I saw them 1 time in our 11 day trip and I knew that. Others who don't know are often a bit disappointed. It's more grey and only a touch of green. It looks mysterious. I think the puffins are a great choice. I didn't see them so I bought a pullover with a puffin on it :D,1,
Post,Does my April 2025 Itinerary look okay?,Playful-Physics501,2024-10-07 10:14:19,"Hi all, 2 other friends and I will be visiting Iceland in April - I've created a high level itinerary based on reviews online / reddit posts and wondering if there's anything I've missed or if this itinerary might be too ambitious? Have buffered for 2 days in Husavik since I've heard whale watching can be weather dependent and they only confirm on the date.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!!

Comment,,BionicGreek,2024-10-08 03:33:29,"You may be slightly early for the puffins depending when in April you are arriving. They start to trickle in mid to late April. 

Be cautious going to west fjords in April as snow may not have completely melted and roads can be treacherous.",2,

Post,"TRIP REPORT: Sept 18-29 Ring Road + West Fjords in camper, plus a little extra",meowkittykat2652,2024-10-03 21:46:42,"Day 1 – arrive at KEF @ 6:00am via Icelandair.  Flight was warm, as others have mentioned.  The entertainment, WIFI and charging in the seat backs was not working, so the flight was a little restless.  Arrived at Cozy Campers at 9:00am via private transfer booked through Cozy Campers and picked up our camper van.  We had reservations at Sky Lagoon at 10:00am thinking it would help refresh us after a seven-hour flight.  I think it did the trick.  We did the seven-step ritual and enjoyed the warm water.  It was very crowded and busy.  We spent about 2 hours or so here.  

We then headed to a grocery store and then hit the road toward Landmannalaugar campground where we spent our first night.  This was a long drive to add on to all the travel (3 hours or so) but we took out time, and enjoyed the scenery.  This route did require driving on a 4x4 road with two water crossings.  There was a spot to park/camp before the water crossings if those make you nervous.  We had a quick and simple dinner and went right to sleep at dark. Total time awake was about 36 hours or so.  Around 11:30pm I woke up and had to use the restroom.  Snow was blowing, it was dark, it was chilly.  The toilet was freezing. I came out of the rest room a few minutes later to clear sky and low wind and northern lights!  This was our first of three nights seeing them on our trip. 

https://preview.redd.it/pfmhxinj2msd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=257b0ae440d3306a62a6ca13b577374642971b08

Day 2 – We originally planned to do a hike this day since we were waking up near trail heads in Landmannalaugar.  However, after a very long day and half of travel without sleep, we slept in and soaked in the natural hot spring river instead. This was an excellent choice and might have been our favorite of the hot springs we went to. A true 10/10 experience.  It was the hottest water we soaked in the whole trip, and we spent about one-hour in the water with only two other people nearby.  We left Landmannalaugar and took our time heading to Reykholt, for reservations at Friðheimar Tomato Farm. This was also an excellent experience and our first real meal since arriving in Iceland. We ordered several dishes and had a marvelous time.  Everything was absolutely excellent.  We then drove another hour to spend the night at Hvolsvöllur campground, had an early night.

https://preview.redd.it/chy24pem2msd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee3efd9f45817b1a3e63f36d9ba422cb59220f08

Day 3 – Got an early start to the day and left the campground at 7:00 for a day of the South Coast and waterfalls.  We hit to Seljalandsfoss first just before tour busses arrived.  We walked down the trail and found Gljufrabui and had it all to ourselves.  Walking back to the parking lot we passed lots of others heading to Gljufrabui and by the time we got back to the parking lot there were several tour busses and lots of people. We headed to Skogafoss next, and after spending some time down low, we made the trek up the stairs to enjoy the view from up high.  We then spent about two and a half hours hiking the Fimmvorduhals trail, which was beautiful.  The farther we went the more we had to all to ourselves. The weather was fair, and the wind was low.  Heading back toward Skogafoss and the parking lot the sun came out which made it all the better.  We continued on to Vik and had lunch at a brewery after a very busy morning. We took the afternoon to backtrack slightly to Reynisfjara and spent about an hour or so there walking the beach and taking photos.  We spent the night at the Vik campground which was by far the fullest campground we stayed at on our trip.

Day 4 – We had a glacier tour early in the morning out of Vik with Troll Expeditions.  Our original itinerary had us doing a different Ice Cave Tour departing out of the Jökulsárlón area, but that was canceled (we totally understood why) and Troll gave us options to reschedule out of other locations or cancel all together.  We chose to reschedule for the Katla Ice Cave Tour leaving from Vik. Our Tour departed at 7:30. It was short, sweet, very good scenery, our guide was fun, and we were back in Vik by 10:30.  We gassed up, and hit the road for Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach where we had lunch and spent about two hours.  We had stop or two along the way.  Our destination for the night was Hofn, where we had an excellent dinner in town and camped for the night. 

https://preview.redd.it/ykpkr6er2msd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11ffe15b65bbf85726cb79134008c032214de0f1

Day 5 – We got an early start for a long day of driving, pulling away from the campground around 7:30am.  To anyone doing the drive from Hofn to Akureryi, it is totally do able, but please know this is a long day.  We stopped at the Viking Café for coffee before hitting the road.  We did not go to Stokksnes because it was cloudy, and we had time constraints. We planned for a stop at Studagil Canyon which was about halfway along the drive.  The turn off of Road 1 is not paved for the east side parking lot.  Again, fine for us, but we did see two cars tipped off the side of the road.  It was a clear day, no poor weather.  Getting to the Canyon is a bit of a walk once you make it to the parking lot, more so if you must park in a different lot before the 4x4 road.  There were quite a lot of people here, maybe because we hit it around mid-day.  We spent about 1 hour here, give or take 15 minutes.  We made sandwiches and had lunch in the parking lot, switched drivers and continued to Akureyri.

https://preview.redd.it/nvva4zfz2msd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0628d8d08f93b218e6d8d0c6945a7094c70515db

We arrived in Akureyri around 5:00pm.  For our stay in Akureyri, we reserved a guest house with laundry facilities so we could reset and refresh in the middle of our road trip. We stayed in the guesthouse all three nights we were in Akureyri.  We had an early dinner walking distance from our guesthouse and then went to Forrest Lagoon and spent about 2.5 hours there.  This was my second favorite of the hot springs.  There were a good number of people here, but it did not feel as crowded as Sky Lagoon and was very enjoyable.  We left around closing and saw northern lights from the parking lot!

https://preview.redd.it/70mxggm13msd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bedb170e85e0b4e9386b4b46a66fec526e77c4d

Day 6 – Rest day.  Spent the day exploring around Akureyri, went to the botanic gardens, went to the Christmas Store (this was skippable to us in hindsight), did some shopping and walking around.  Two Cruise ships docked this day, so town was a little full, but good people watching and everyone was pleasant.  We had dinner and did a tasting menus at Mulaberg on the suggestion of a bartender in town.  It was very good.  The weather for the next day was forecasted to become increasingly stormy, so during dinner we also corresponded with North Sailing to rearrange our Whale Watching tour at their recommendation.  Tours out of Husavik were cancelled (our original tour) and we were rescheduled for the 10:00am tour out of Árskógssandur instead, which was 30 minutes north of town.

Day 7 – Morning whale watching excursion out of Árskógssandur with North Sailing.  This was by far our worst weather day.  It was cloudy, windy, and rainy.  We did see some whales though, so overall a successful outing.  We spent the afternoon finishing up laundry and getting things in order for hitting the road the next day and having a cozy night in while it was stormy outside. We got burgers to-go from Taste which was a quick walk from out guest house and very delicious.

https://preview.redd.it/04ecj5jx2msd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c8e86566ff6460565d5c6ff2afe4afd77762e44

Day 8 – Left Akureryi to head to Holmavik, and our ultimate destination of Drangsnes.  The drive was beautiful with snowcapped mountains from the storm the day before.  Waze took us on an unexpected detour that added an hour to our dive but we got to see a little extra of the West Fjords and had gas to spare.  We arrived in Holmavik around 2:30, and went to the Witchcraft Museum, which was very interesting and worth a stop if you are into that kind of thing.  We probably spent a little over an hour here, and then pushed on to Drangsnes.  The hot pots by the sea were empty, so before heading to the campground, we parked, paid (there is a credit card machine here), and soaked for about an hour or so.  As time passed, a few more people joined, and we left as a group was arriving.  Camped at Drangsnes campground.  We were the only ones.  We saw northern lights this night that they were nothing short of spectacular.  We saw faint lights just after sunset, and as the night went on they became stronger and stronger spreading across the while sky.  I believe the KP index that night was a 4, and there was not a cloud in the sky, very little wind.  It was amazing and we had it all to ourselves as the only campers that night.

Day 9 – Left drive Drangsnes campground around 8:30am, gassed up in Holmavik, and headed to Dynjandi.  The scenery on the drive was spectacular.  The West Fjords seemed to be in it’s peak fall moments.  Spent about an hour or so at Dynjandi.  There is a bit of a hike if you are feeling up for it to get close to the falls.  Had lunch in the parking lot and then a 30 minute drive the Ferry dock.  I thought it would be fun to take the Ferry from the WF to Snæfellsnes, but we were very early for the Ferry time and we could have driven and arrived in Stykkishólmur much earlier had we not had Ferry reservations.  However, we were on vacation, so we stopped in Flókalundur, had some coffee and pie at the restaurant which was closing for the season in five days,  and then parked at the Ferry dock and laid down in the back of our van for an hour and a half with the heater keeping us Cozy.  In hindsight, the Ferry is rather skippable and we would not do this again.  We arrived in Stykkishólmur around 8:00pm and then had an excellent dinner at Sjávarpakkhúsið.  We did make a reservation a few weeks in advance.  Highly recommend.  Everything was fantastic and very reasonably priced.   We camped at Stykkishólmur camping ground which was probably the least clean and our least favorite of the campgrounds.

Day 10 – Got a bit of an early start, and spent the day driving  around Snæfellsnes Peninsula before heading back to Reykjavík.  In hindsight, I would have liked to have spent a day Stykkishólmur.  It seemed like a very cute fishing town.  Our first stop was Kirkjufell.  It was cloudy and the top third was obscured by clouds.  We spent about an hour hoping a little more of the mountain would reveal itself, but no luck.  We drove on to Búðakirkja (which was beautiful) and then went to Ytri Tunga.  Not many seals on the rocks, but we could see activity far out offshore.  After this stop we seemed to be ready to end our road trip and relax.  The Snæfellsnes area seems very doable for a day trip, as the things to see and do are very close together compared to other parts of Iceland and within an hour or two of Reykjavík.  We notified Cozy Campers we would be a few hours early returning our van.  We checked into our guesthouse first, moved all our personal items from the van to the guest house, filled the van with gas and swept out the dirt and returned the van.  This was relatively easy and quick.  Maybe 30 minutes or so.  We asked Cozy Campers to call us a taxi to take us back to our guesthouse.  We decompressed for a little and then went to dinner reservations at La Primavera, which was about a 20-minute walk.  Dinner was excellent, but no feel or taste of Iceland (it’s an Italian restaurant and we didn't necessarily expect that).  We made the booking based on the Down to Earth Episode on Iceland and our mouths watering as they did a little story on the restaurant.  Again, the food was great, but we were within much closing walking distance to a lot of other spots that were probably much less expensive and just as good of dining.  It seemed to be a special local spot though as there was a family birthday celebration and another special occasion dinner for what looked like some local Icelandic families.

Day 11 – Spent the day exploring Reykjavík, visiting tourist shops on and near Rainbow Street. Dinner reservations at Dill.  Our experience was excellent.  We did the tasting menu with wine pairing.  It was about $300 USD/person which is on par with the only other Michelin star restaurant I have been to.  The experience, the service and the food were all outstanding. On the way home we stopped in to a restaurant our guesthouse host recommended.  We regretted this after.  We were riding a high from our Dill experience an wanting to try a few more things specific to Iceland before we left the next day.  I believe the second restaurant  was called Tapas Barinn.  It was very loud and crowded, and our server forgot about our table.  The food was good, we ordered the Icelandic lobster and puffin, but it felt overpriced both for food and drink.  We spent about $120 USD for one drink per person (so two drinks) and two small plates, which to me didn’t feel worth it.  My companion wasn’t bothered but we left because they wished to order another drink and our server never returned.  After about 10 minutes we gave up, paid and went home. 

Day 12 – We got some coffee and pastries, got our packing in order and decided to make the 2km trek to the central bus station and take the Flybus to the airport instead of figure out a private transfer.  My ability to make calls wasn’t working very well and a private transfer was between $120-$150 USD.  The Flybus was something like $25 or $30 USD.  The walk felt long rolling our suitcases and carrying backpacks, but it was along the lake and over in about 25 minutes.  The Flybus was strait forward, and we got to the airport with lots of time to kill before our flight home.  We stopped at the Tax Refund window.  Fill this paperwork out in advance.  It’s very simple and makes the process at the airport much easier.  We had about 3 hours to kill before our flight home, so we played cards and passed the time.

Final Thoughts:

Highlights: Landmannalaugar hot springs river, Friðheimar Tomato Farm, dinner at Sjávarpakkhúsið, northern lights sightings, the town of Akureyri, my little painting by a local artist from Akureyri Art Museum gift shop, my Icelandic Blanket from the Hand Knitting Association and little wool elves for friends and family.

Cozy Campers – this was a just fine choice.  The van space was a little smaller than expected.  We rented the Highlander III, thinking we would appreciate the extra space (it can seat and sleep three and we were two).  However, the extra sleep space compromised storage space and this was a challenge. We liked the moon roof and extra windows provided as it did help it feel less claustrophobic.  The heater worked like a champ at night and the only nights we were cold were because we were trying to figure out a good heat setting.  The customer service was fine.  I personally would have appreciated a little more handholding from Cozy, but we got along just fine with the attention we were given. While I think doing a camper and cooking most of your meals can save you money on your trip, our goal was flexibility, so this trip report isn’t about doing things as cost effectively as possible.  We did see lots of people with less expensive campers and even tents and eating cost effective meals from grocery stores.  It’s very doable to do this trip less expensively.

Weather – we were able to pack so much in because we got unbelievably lucky with the weather.  Most of our time was dry and low to moderate winds and we had just as many sun days as cloudy.

Rain/Wind layer – this is crucial. We are from Colorado, used to all four seasons and all the weather in between.  The ability to block the bite the wind has is the key to staying warm.   Some days I only wore my rain pants, and light sweatshirt and rain jacket and was just fine. We both packed lots of lighter layers.  The times I was chilly were little pit stops on the road where I got out without my rain/wind layer and the breeze or wind just cuts right through you.

Waterproof boots were also very valuable and necessary for waterfalls, hiking, and when it rained, and things got a little muddy.  You want the ability to walk through whatever is on the ground, not dance around it to save your socks. Get the proper shoes.

Layers – look up proper layering techniques so you don’t over or under pack if this is important to you.  Make sure things are sweat wicking and breathable.  Days where I layered most I had an all season sweat wicking base layer, a midweight breathable second layer, breathable fleece layer, puffy layer, rainproof/water proof layer on my top half.  Bottom half Kari Traa wool base layer bottoms, water resistant hiking pants from REI, and rain pants.

Northern Lights photographing – doing a little research before your trip goes a long way on this and this sub is a wealth of information.  All my photos are from my iPhone 14 Pro.  Lights were photographed in night mode with 3 seconds exposure.

  
English and credit cards - credit card machines are literally everywhere, even if you are going somewhere remote and expecting there to be an on-your-honor system.  The system will be electronic.  Everyone spoke English except a few interactions in the WF. Even then, we could still communicate fine and it was never a significant issue. ",6,4.0
Post,Help us choose our 2025 trip dates! Late August or mid September?,nyxsyn1,2024-09-29 15:23:46,"We are planning a trip for September next year! We saw somewhere that new moon with darker skies make for better chance of aurora, how true is it?

With the new moon next year occuring at 23Aug & 22Sep, we are considering between (1) 26Aug-6Sep and (2) 9Sep-20Sep. 

Option#1 would allow a slight chance of seeing the puffins too but would it be too early in the season to catch northern lights? Option #2 might get us a higher chance of catching it but at risk of bad weather? Is it cutting too close to winter driving conditions? We could do a week earlier too but just trying to avoid full moon on 8Sep, how much does this matter?

Help us decide! Which would you choose? Any other considerations? Any tips are welcome! We are so excited seeing all the aurora photos here and cant wait to start planning.",1,11.0
Comment,,NoLemon5426,2024-09-29 16:28:36,"The risk of 'bad weather' is any time of year, the difference between these dates is normally insignificant so don't worry about this. The wintry weather this year is definitely early, with early September usually being quite summery still. Puffins will likely only be around in Heimaey, *maybe* some in or around Vík. I also would not plan around the moon phase.

Honestly, just pick the dates that work best for you and whatever else is happening in life. If you're camping or using a van I would pick the earlier dates since nearly all campsites should still be open. If you aren't camping or using a van, please do not use AirBnB or other short term rentals* which has done measurable and demonstrable damage to the housing market for Icelanders. Housing is already strained and then with the entire town of Vík being displaced less than a year ago + immigration issues, lots of Icelanders have no where to live. Use hotels and guesthouses which are intended very specifically for travelers.

*Bungalo.com is truly local and mostly Icelanders' summer homes you can rent if you so wish.",2,

We did catch the Aurora.  The new moon did help us see a kp1 show.  Although, the week before and after also had great showings based on the posts on this sub.  That said, it's not a guarantee.  We spoke to some folks who were  there the same time we were who didn't see them.",1,

Post,Obligatory “missing Iceland” post ,HeartOfGoldATX,2024-09-25 14:36:16,"Trip highlights included… hiking the Fimmvörðuháls Trail, exploring Thórsmörk (we stayed at the Básar Hut), tons of waterfalls, relaxing in hot springs, unexpectedly good weather most of the time, seeing the northern lights the last few nights, and surprisingly, the Reykjavík food tour was a ton of fun. We also went to the Westman Islands, which was cool (unfortunately no puffins), but had to take the ferry detour back because of the wind and that was a less-than-fun 3-hour puke fest 😅

Post,"Short Westfjords Trip Review
",mlke,2024-09-17 15:41:38,"I recently took a trip to Iceland and used this subreddit as a good source of info to plan our West Iceland adventure, so I wanted to give back and leave a review of our itinerary as it seemed like documented Westfjord experiences are far fewer than those of other, more popular areas. In total I had 9 days for the entire trip and did about 3 days there. I’ll list off each day to give a sense of the actual logistics, but will only go into detail for those 3 days. 

Biggest take-aways: driving in the Westfjords was not that scary and definitely does not need a 4x4 IF you stick to the double numbered roads. Two crucial decisions also made this a piece of cake from a driving perspective. First- doing the trip clockwise. Doing it counterclockwise puts you on the outer lane along most of the fjords, which seems like a totally different experience if you’re a little nervous about that. Second may be more controversial but they wouldn’t have fit into this timeline anyways, and it’s skipping two of the most talked about attractions- Látrabjarg and Rauðisandur Beach. See below for more details!

—-------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1 - Reykjavik 

Day 2 - South side of Snæfellsnes Peninsula

Day 3 - North side of Peninsula and Westfjords

After waking up in Olafsvik we slowly made our way to Stykkishólmur to take the Ferry Baldur to the Westfjords at 3 pm. It turned out to be a great time frame that let us explore the northern half of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula a bit. Getting onto the ferry was super easy- just scan your ticket and drive into the ship’s hull. We got a bit of motion sickness with the swells in the first half, but were fine in the second half of the trip. A post here actually reminded me that the ferry is still subject to the whims of nature and could be canceled if the weather is really bad…so consider an alternative route if you want to be extra safe! As to the ferry itself- there was lots of room to spread out and even lie down and sleep in the ship’s seated areas. Once we docked on the other side we hit up a hot spring and stayed in Patreksfjörður for the night. Coming down off the mountains into that first fjord was the only time I felt really nervous driving (for about 3 minutes). Being on the outer lane with no guard rail and high visibility to the bottom was slightly vertigo-inducing but it was the only time I really felt that way, and the road was completely empty (and paved). Going slow and focusing on the road is the best thing to do and you’ll be fine. In general the roads here were wide and empty. 

Touching on Látrabjarg and Rauðisandur Beach- we would not have had the time to get there and do much after taking the 3 pm ferry and landing in the Westfjords at about 5:30 pm. Based on the distances and gravel roads I would guess it would take over half a day to visit both without a lot of wandering around. Those roads also seemed like the roads people complain about the most, but honestly after having traveled the island I think I could have tried them (they are not F-roads). Overall though I still got a good feel for the area and still enjoyed it without getting to these spots. 

Day 4 - Dynjandi & Ísafjörður

We woke up in Patreksfjörður and headed clockwise around highway 63. The road turned to gravel a little past Bíldudalur, and had a consistent amount of small potholes all along the coast. We just went slow but that was fine because the views were great. I think everyone who caught up to us ended up passing us, which was fine. The road condition was nothing worse than what I experienced getting to Brúarfoss in the golden circle, and I imagine even a lower clearance vehicle could have managed. This road eventually gained elevation but didn’t seem that difficult up into the mountains. It did however feel SPOOKY at times- when the fog gets thick and you haven't seen anyone for 20-30 minutes at the top of a martian landscape, it's a bit of a thrill- but not necessarily difficult to drive through. So that was really the end of the driving difficulty, as once you connect back to highway 60 it is paved or at least in the process of being paved- and pothole free. 

We got into Dynjandi around 11 maybe? I was surprised to see it teeming with tourists. For how remote the areas around it feel, it was interesting to see a steady stream of tour buses bringing people in and out. Still enjoyable but understand it may be crowded. From here we drove north to Ísafjörður. This is the part of the drive where you can begin to trust google maps estimates again. We stopped into Flateyri where we also encountered tour buses haha! We then continued through the single-lane tunnel to Ísafjörður (going north the way we did gives you the right-of-way and the other cars pull over, another plus of going clockwise for this trip). We arrived right when a cruise ship was docked, so it felt a little hectic with people flocking for the stores, but most people completely vanished back onto the ships by the time we ate dinner. The town was nice even if most places had really limited hours. 

Day 5 - More fjords back towards Borgarnes

We woke up, went to a cafe and got on the road. Driving south around the final set of fjords was yet another unique experience. All the way to Holmavik was really cool actually- mountains turned to rolling hills and unusually more desolate landscapes. We had a few stops along the way including two trails and a seal outlook. From Holmavik we continued south towards the southern coast and got a hotel just north of Borgarnes. The terrain continued to be beautiful so the driving was not bad, even if it was one of our longest driving days.

Day 6 - Golden Circle

Day 7-9 Southern Coast then back to Keflavik Airport

—-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall it was a great trip, and I was relieved that the Westfjords were easy to navigate. If I were to go back I would try a little harder to find more places to get out of my car and explore- perhaps stopping at the beach and puffin cliffs I mentioned earlier. Perhaps stopping in Þingeyri, or just following gravel roads out to the tips of the fjords more often (according to F-road restrictions). I think finding these places to explore is not as obvious and well-documented as it is in the US, but it makes finding them a little more special. 

Other random tips: turn on the terrain feature on google maps to more accurately predict where the road will gain elevation and what you’ll be driving through. I saw Siminn mentioned a lot here as the sim card to purchase, but the airport didn’t have them so we bought Nova. That worked out everywhere we went so their network coverage was fine. Food and Gas were big expenses. I picked up some Hardfiskur (dried fish jerky), with bread and butter, which was my go-to lunch whenever we didn’t stop at a restaurant. It was ok at first, then I actually really liked it lol. It's important to also check the closing times of grocery stores if you plan on eating cheap. Somtimes we would end our day at around 7 and find most places closed- especially around saturday/sunday. Overall I spent $1500 across 9 days not including the expenses for the actual car rental and lodging. ",6,7.0

I returned from my second trip to Iceland over a month ago and am finally getting around to writing this. It was amazing, of course! And it was also a great learning experience. I really had to heed the advice I see repeated here about how to prepare for disruptions. It didn’t all go as planned but I wouldn’t change a thing. We’re for sure going to be back.

I traveled with my partner; I’m in my late 40s and he’s in his late 50s. We’re not super athletic but we do shorter hikes pretty regularly. We rented a 4WD vehicle, and my partner did all the driving. (I don’t yet have a full driver’s license, just a motorcycle license. Getting my full license would be helpful, but I don’t think I’d be up for driving in Iceland as a relatively new driver… it will be a few years before I can help out.) We visited Iceland in April 2023 for 9 days during which we hit most of (but not all of) the popular south coast points of interest we wanted to see as well as Westman Islands, Snaefelsness Peninsula, the Golden Circle, and Reykjavik. With 15 days this time, we planned to do the entire ring road and the Westfjords, without spending too much time in areas we’d already been to but making a bit of time for a few sites we’d missed. [I made a previous post about our accommodations](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1epslpp/accommodation_reviews_information/) so I’ll be brief about them here.

 Day 1 – Arrival. Arrived at KEF after an overnight flight from Toronto. The flight left at 11 pm so I’d hoped we’d both be super tired and able to sleep pretty normally on the plane, but no such luck. We arrived at about 9 am and had an easy time getting through the airport and picking up our car at Blue. I really wanted to see Hvammsvik and this was out of the way but the only day we could really fit it in. It was probably not a great idea to do so much driving after so little sleep. On our first trip, Day 1 was salvaged by jumping into the Blue Lagon right away, and next time I’d opt for a closer public pool as our first stop. We stopped at the Bonus in Keflavik to pick up a few groceries and snacks and then some delicious and missed gas station sandwiches before driving to Hvammsvik spa for our 2:30 reservation. It was a beautiful drive on a sunny day and the roads were good, but we were soooo tired. It was a relief to get in the water. There were about 5 or 6 hot pots in a beautiful natural setting, and we did the cold plunge in the Atlantic ocean, which definitely helped to wake us up! It was fairly busy, but not super crowded. Lots of beautiful people and it felt very, very spa-like. Luxurious and lovely, but I think my next trip will be much more focused on public pools and hotpots we find in the wild. We drove to our accommodations at Farmhotel Efstidalur, where we’d stayed one night during our first trip, and which we had loved. We splurged and ordered the dinner special at the restaurant there – roast beef dinner. It was delicious and so filling we couldn’t even finish it. We slept early and well.

 Day 2 – Landmannalaugar. Enjoyed an excellent breakfast at the farmhotel before heading out to Landmannalaugar. We drove the northern route to avoid river crossings. It was a long but beautiful drive. We stopped at the Highland Centre to use the washroom just before beginning the much anticipated F208. This road is nuts. I have never been on a road like this in my life. We stopped at Sigoldugljufur Canyon, which was an easy 15 minute walk from the parking lot. Really beautiful canyon in the middle of a desolate volcanic landscape. I just couldn’t believe the rest of the drive. I kept thinking, “Really?! We’re allowed to drive here?!” It’s not a gravel road; it’s a ROCK road. The car and I were shaking during much of the trip, but we didn’t see much traffic and could drive slowly and let people pass. It became a more reasonable gravel road as we neared Langmannalaugar, and the only actually kind of scary bit was right at the end, on a very narrow road with more height and no guardrails. Most of the drive was just weird and uncomfortable but not scary. As we approached the park there was someone there to check our parking reservations, which we had made several months earlier. We parked in the lot right before the river crossing which we were definitely not bold enough to attempt. It’s just a quick 5 minute walk over the river to the campground. There are great washroom facilities and an information kiosk where you can buy maps, snacks, and other necessities. It’s beautiful. Already, I could see a colourful mountain in the background. We decided to just do the lava field hike, which still took a couple of hours as we like to take our time and stop at all the lookouts. It’s definitely easier than climbing a mountain (which we had debated), but not without its challenges. We did the loop counterclockwise. There was a bit of an incline at the beginning, but mostly the hike is level and easy for anyone. Near the end of the hike there was a lot of scrambling over rocks (lava!} which was awesome but would be challenging or impossible for folks with mobility issues. The scenery was out of this world. We were lucky to be there on a fairly sunny day. Painted mountains in the background, black lava rocks in the foreground, it was like nothing I’ve ever experienced before and was absolutely worth the completely bonkers road trip. Afterwards, my partner soaked in the hot springs with a tonne of other people, but I felt too uncomfortable to get changed out in the open to partake myself. If this had been Day 15 instead of Day 2 I probably would have done it, but still not comfortable enough. He thoroughly enjoyed it. The drive back felt easier and definitely less exciting. We decided to have dinner at the Highland Centre as it was getting late and we were worried we might not make it back to the farmhotel in time for dinner. The dinner menu was pretty expensive, but they let us order burgers off the daytime menu even though it was past the cut off time. They were good burgers and not too outrageously priced. We slept well but knew we had to make a big decision in the morning,

 Day 3 – Change of Plans. We’d learned the previous day that part of the ring road had been closed due to flooding and it seemed like it would take a while to repair. We had to decide if we were going to continue on to the south coast as planned and cross our fingers or forfeit the next couple of nights, find new accommodations on the other side of the country instead, and head in the opposite direction to save most of our reservations. We gave ourselves until after we finished another delicious farmhotel breakfast to make the call and decided finally to drive north to the Akureyri area. We had planned a 1.5 hour drive to Skogafoss where we were going to do a part of the hike above the falls (we had climbed to the top on our first trip but hadn’t done the hike because our day was so packed, but missing this hike was our biggest regret!) before taking it easy at our amazing sounding and much anticipated stay at The Garage. It was gonna be a lovely and chill day. Instead, I scrambled to book a new hotel for the next two nights and to see what I could do about getting refunds for the two nights we had to cancel. (The Garage refunded us – THANK YOU! The other place did not. Neither of them were under any obligation to do so.) Then we spent 7 hours driving to a new farmhotel in Laugar. It was not a fun drive. We were just trying to get there to head towards the rest of our itinerary, and didn’t stop for anything except gas and coffee and soup. We followed Googlemaps blindly through some weird backroad in Thingvellir and then weaved through the countryside and the absolute middle of nowhere on unpaved roads for the first couple of hours before we finally caught up to the ring road again. We stopped for gas and some unimpressive meat soup (me) and fish and chips (my partner) at a gas station along the ring road but otherwise we just tried to keep going, knowing we’d be back that way in a few days anyway. We made up some time on the ring road but driving around the mountains in the north was pretty scary for my partner who still wasn’t used to this kind of driving yet. We knew there wasn’t a restaurant at our accommodation, and we were lucky that we arrived just before 8, when the gift shop at Godafoss, directly across the street from our accommodations at Fljotsbakki Farm Hotel, closed. Their hot food was all put away but we managed to grab some sandwiches and muffins for dinner. Our accommodations were okay, but not the place we had been looking forward to and we were so tired and bummed out by the time we got there. It was a hard, disappointing, stressful day.

 Day 4 – The North! We rallied, and we learned a lot, and we made some more changes to our plans. It became pretty clear that my partner did not want to be doing super long drives that were also potentially kind of scary. It was really stressful for both of us. So we took a look at our itinerary and made some changes while we were still able to rebook accommodations with no financial penalty. We decided we’d take the ferry back from the Westfjords to cut out some of the driving and make it so that he was never doing more than 3.5 hours of driving in a day. We cut out the Trollaskagi Peninsula entirely. And we relished the fact that we now had this bonus day in the north to explore some of the things we weren’t supposed to get to for another few days. We got a late start after a mediocre breakfast and ended up having a great day. We drove around part of Myvatn and climbed the pseudocraters (very easy, short trail} before enjoying ice cream at Skutais. It was too windy for midges! We went to the Grotagja cave which was a quick stop – right beside the parking lot, and not too many people ahead of us. We drove further around the lake to the Hverir geothermal area, which was awesome and again left us feeling like we were on another planet. Paths around boiling mudpots, and you could choose to hike to the top of the small mountain overlooking the area. We spent about an hour there. We then went to Dettifoss and Selfoss, which were both amazing. All of these drives were very easy and along paved roads. Note that we went to the main entrance for Dettifoss and Selfoss; I know there is another entrance as well. It was about a km to get to Dettifoss from the parking lot, and the trail is totally easy and flat and through interesting rock formations. Selfoss is worth checking out as well. We stopped at Dalakofinn Utibu in Laugar for a pizza. We thought it was weird that all the pizzas had cream cheese on them, but it was delicious and filling and a pretty affordable meal. Finally, we drove to Godafoss, arriving after the crowds had mostly gone home. The horseshoe falls were right beside the parking lot and were lovely in the dimming light.

 Day 5 – Studagil Canyon. After another mediocre breakfast at Fljotsbakki Farm Hotel we made the 2 hour drive to Studagil Canyon. The roads were easy until we got to the turn off to the canyon itself. Honestly, this was the most unnerving drive of our entire trip! The dirt road was in poor condition, extremely narrow, and took us directly alongside the steep canyon. The road is clearly under construction so I’m sure it will eventually be a smoother ride, but I just felt fortunate we didn’t have rain or much oncoming traffic to contend with. We drove to the east side parking lot closest to the canyon and it was so busy we were lucky to find a spot. Parking was a but chaotic, without clearly defined spots, but everyone was generally respectful There are public washrooms and a small food stand on site. From this parking lot it was a very easy but boring 40-minute walk to Studagil Canyon. It was absolutely worth the treacherous drive. We spent about three hours there, climbing in and around and on the canyon. It was very crowded but everyone was good about looking out for one another. This was a highlight of our trip, for sure. We then drove to Egilsstadir for dinner, and decided to just share a pizza again, as we’d found it a really cost effective and filling meal. This time we just went to a gas station and the pizza was great there, too! Iceland does pizza very well. We were now, finally, back to our planned accommodations. We stayed in a great room at the wonderful Hotel Eyvindara in an Icelandic forest. We soaked in the onsite hot tub and sat outside our room looking at the surrounding trees, almost feeling like we were back at home in Ontario.

 Day 6 – Seydisfjordur. After a delicious hotel breakfast we decided to embrace our newfound less-is-more / we-can’t-see-it-all attitude and forgo our planned Hengifoss hike in favour of just hanging out in the neighbouring town of Seydisfjordur. It was a short half hour drive down a beautiful but, of course, somewhat unnerving mountain road. All paved, though! Our first stop was to check out the sound sculpture, Tvisongur. The googlemap directions were a bit misleading and initially led us into an industrial area we clearly weren’t supposed to be in. We found the path leading from the parking lot though, with a sign indicating a short trek of less than a km, which we were delighted to read. It did, however, turn out to be all up a fairly a steep hill! The path was clearly marked and straightforward. It was a pretty cool sound sculpture, like a domed cement cave with rooms of various sizes. We walked around singing and harmonizing and listening to how the tones changes from room to room before going back into the main town to stroll around. We walked along the harbour, went to the rainbow street, and visited the church before having some tasty lamb soup at The Filling Station, the aptly named gas station restaurant. We went to Skaftfell Art Centre, which was founded by Dieter Ross, an artist my partner was familiar with. There was an exhibit on whales in the gallery upstairs and in the café downstairs there was information about Dieter Ross and the founding of the centre. I found a great book called *The Museum of Whales you will Never See and Other Excursions to Iceland’s most Unusual Museums*, by A. Kenra Greene\*.\* We grabbed a couple of coffees for the road and headed back to Egilsstadir where we did some souvenir shopping. Hus Handanna had a nice variety of souvenirs and prints and I found a beautiful lopeysa at another craft store in town.

 Day 7 – Puffins! After another great hotel breakfast we picked up some groceries at the Bonus in town before making the hour long drive to Borgarfjordar Eystri. At this point it became clear that a lot of what was causing my partner to feel pretty low energy was a bit of a head cold. We had an AMAZING and truly revitalizing bowl of soup at Alfacafe. It came with unlimited bread and refills as well as coffee or tea and was exactly what we needed to give us the strength to carry on to the puffin cliffs. They were awesome. If you care even a little bit about seeing puffins (and I really did care only a very little bit) this is absolutely the place to be. In fact it made me think that perhaps I cared about puffins a whole lot, after all. They were all over the cliffs, just hanging out, occasionally taking flight. Literally within an arm’s reach. SO MANY of them! I couldn’t believe how relaxed they were around the throngs of tourists. We then checked into our most anticipated and favourite accommodations of our whole trip – a studio apartment at Blabjorg Resort. We had intentionally planned a mid-trip vacation-within-a-vacation here, booking it for two nights and knowing we could just stay put and get some laundry done. We did three loads of laundry in the very small washing machine that was in our room and hung our clothes to dry on every flat surface we could find. We crashed early, and my partner got some much needed and restorative downtime.

 Day 8 – Rest Day. Not only was my partner feeling awful, but this was also, astoundingly, the first day we experienced really bad weather. After an amazing on site breakfast we hunkered down watching movies and the storm raged outside. The wind blew our patio furniture off our deck! We made some soup and sandwiches with our Bonus groceries. We had planned to use the onsite spa including outdoor hottubs but decided that was not the way to go given the weather and the way my partner was feeling. The rest day was exactly what we both needed.

 Day 9 – Husavik. My partner woke up feeling so much better, and the weather was again fully cooperative. After breakfast we walked out to the pier by our accommodation and went to see the turf house in the centre of the village before retracing our steps back north. We bypassed Dettifoss this time and went to Aspyrgi Canyon. We did a short hike through the forest and to a couple of lookout spots around the canyon. It was lovely and peaceful. There were people there, but it was far less crowded than most of the places we’d been. From there, we drove to Husavik where we stayed at the Husavik Cape Hotel. Attached to the hotel was the Eurovision Museum, featuring exhibits from the contest as well as the movie of the same name. It was fun (we enjoyed the movie),and was free for all hotel guests. We were hoping to get dinner at the Ja Ja Ding Dong bar but it turned out they didn’t have much of a food menu, so we ate (really good) fish and chips from a take-out place on the harbour. We parked our car back at the hotel and walked the 10 minutes to GeoSea, where we had made 8:00 reservations months ago. The skies were clear and we relaxed in the hot infinity pools overlooking the Atlantic ocean. Perfect way to end the day.

 Day 10 – Akureyri. We had a mediocre hotel breakfast before driving to Akureyri for the day. We decided to take the toll tunnel to save us the stress of more mountain roads, and we’re glad we did. We headed straight for the Christmas House, which was pretty wonderful. The faux gingerbread house had a great selection of ornaments for sale, and there were all kinds of festive treats like hot apple cider and candy apples available. There were elf-sized Christmas houses as well as the world’s largest advent calendar. We then went to Forest Lagoon for our 12:30 reservation. It was lovely and relaxing and in a beautiful setting as well but, again, I think I am now over the spas. It was a civic holiday and there was a big festival going on in town, so lots of people were out and about. We went to the botanical gardens, which were beautiful, and after seeing all the flowers and plants we had some coffee and shared a piece of cake at the café there. We strolled around the town for a bit waiting for the Indian Curry House to open for dinner. (It had been recommended here on reddit). We found a great used bookstore and really enjoyed the feel of the town, including the troll garbage cans and heart stoplights. Dinner was great. We then got back on the ring road and drove to our accommodations in Varmahild.

 Day 11 – Towards Westfjords. We had another great hotel breakfast before getting an early start on our drive towards the Westfjords; we were super nervous about this drive and knew they were calling for rain. After stopping for gas, we began the coastal drive towards Holmavik. It was stunningly beautiful. I was less nervous during the drive than I thought I’d be, though I’m not sure I can say the same for my partner, who was actually doing the driving! (He just chimed in to say he thought this was scarier than Studagil canyon!) Weaving in and out of the fjords along roads that were often gravel, sometimes very high up and with no guardrails was for sure tense at times. We drove through the clouds for about 10 terrifying minutes where we could not see more than about a foot ahead of us! It was so absurd I found myself laughing rather than freaking out, and we both agreed it was probably better that we didn’t know what we couldn’t see! We were so relieved to make it to Holmavik in good time and we checked into our guest house before the weather really hit. We had AMAZING spicy fish soup at the café in the Museum of Witchcraft & Sorcery. The museum was fun to explore as well. We napped in our guesthouse for a bit before having dinner at Café Riis. Pizza again and, again, it was great. We slept well as the rain came down outside.

Day 12 – Isafjordur. We had by far the worst breakfast of our trip. Very North American continental breakfast style but without the crappy eggs and sausages. Basically just storebought bread and jam and cereal. But we knew we’d be eating well in our future. We continued along the coast, both awed and afraid. It was such a beautiful sunny day. We passed several motorcyclists (and regular cyclists! And sheep! I should mention these; both sheep and cyclists are everywhere in Iceland.) We stopped at all the viewpoints and had some cake and coffee at our only opportunity to do so before we got to Sudavik. In Sudavik we went to the Arctic Fox Centre, which was quite disappointing and depressing. The exhibits were alright and somewhat informative. There were two foxes in a cage out back and they did not appear to be injured or anything, but I could be wrong! They looked like they were just prisoners and did not look happy to be there at all. We got into Isafjordur at about 3 pm and checked into our amazing boutiquey hotel. We were both quite hungry but hesitant to ruin our appetite for our highly anticipated dinner reservations at 8:30. We broke down and got some noodle soup at Thai Tawee, and it hit the spot. (We eat a lot of Asian food at home and were really missing noodles and rice at this point in our trip!) I was disappointed to learn the Museum of Everyday Life was closed but we went to the Culture House / public library and looked at the exhibits there. I loved the town. I want to come back and spend several days there. It is so beautiful and laidback and yet seemingly has everything one could need. We had dinner at Tjoruhusid which I had been so excited about for about a year and had made reservations several months ago. I can’t even describe what a wonderful experience it was. The fish buffet was one of the best meals I’ve ever had. It started with a fish soup and was followed by a buffet of about 7 different fresh fish dishes and accompanying vegetables. All the fish dishes tasted different from one another and all were amazing. We ate at long communal tables with other guests with whom we had lovely discussions. It was just great. Just go. I’ll be back for sure.

Day 13 – Killing Time in the Westfjords. After an amazing hotel breakfast we drove to Dynjandi, where we’d been planning to spend several hours. The drive was generally okay, for the Icelandic Westfjords. I’d been really looking forward to seeing Dynjandi and indeed it’s an impressive waterfall. You don’t even have to leave the parking lot if you just want to catch a glimpse, but we had been hoping to do some more exploring and to get closer. Unfortunately, the parking lot was as far as we got, as work was being done on the paths to create or improve the viewing platforms. So we found ourselves with a whole lot of extra time to kill before our ferry arrived and no real desire to stray too far afield and risk missing the ferry. So we decided to just make the drive to the ferry terminal and then see what we could see in the immediate area. This was a super sketchy drive, as there was a lot of construction and detours happening, ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN, so once we made it to the ferry terminal we really weren’t going far! Luckily, we discovered there was a hotpot close by, and we spent an hour soaking there. Beautiful views, and not many people around. We met a family from Poland and a couple form the Netherlands with whom we had nice conversations about our trips. We found a little café in the area that had a geology exhibit in the basement and the woman working there told us there was a lovely beach nearby so we spent some time there. It was quite windy but it was a nice place to kill time and there were some cool rock formations. We went back to the ferry terminal and easily boarded the ferry. We had bought out tickets previously. Note that there is no office on the Westfjords side; all tickets must be purchased electronically. The ferry ride was smooth. We watched the Olympics on the tv on the boat and realized our vacation almost exactly corresponded with the timing of the Olympics, and we had pretty much forgotten they were going on. It felt like a weird reminder of the outside world and that our vacation was getting close to being over. We ate predictably not great burgers and fries from the cafeteria on the ferry. The ferry stopped in Flatey, a car-free island that is apparently great for birdwatching. and I definitely want to stop there myself next time! We got into Stykkisholmur at about 8:30 and checked into our hotel which was just a couple of minutes away.

Day 14 – Return to Snaefellsnes. We spent a full day on Snaefellssnes Peninsula on our first trip but there were a few things we missed. Foremost was Vatnshellir cave, which my partner really wanted to see as he’d loved Jules Verne when he was a kid and knew that the area was the inspiration for *Journey to the Centre of the Earth*. We had also missed Stykkisholmur, so we spent the morning in the town. We took the easy trail to the lighthouse, from which we had a great view of the town, before driving through it, only to stumble onto the Library of Water, which I saw was an exhibit by Roni Horn, whose *Island Zombie* I’d read as recommended here on reddit, and had loved. In order to get into the museum you had to go to another museum to pay admission and get a code to enter the building. This was a super fun adventure in our minds, and so we did. The library is comprised of tubes of water extracted from glaciers throughout Iceland! And the view is amazing. After leaving town, we drove to Vatnshellir cave, where we’d made reservations for the mid-afternoon. We were taken down into the cave with a guide and a group of about 15 other people. We were all given hardhats and flashlights before descending down a spiral staircase into the cave. It was easy and there were lots of kids in attendance. The cave was small but not overwhelmingly so, and dark, so keep that in mind if you’re claustrophobic. I was not nervous, but it was definitely strange after going down the second flight of stairs to be plunged into absolute complete darkness when the guide turned off the lighting. We probably spent about 40 minutes in the cave. After this, we went to Ytri Tunga beach, which we had missed on our first trip. We had to scramble over a lot of rocks to get close to the resting seals, but we got SO close, and it was very well worth it! After the beach we drove to our accommodations at the Fossatun Country Hotel, just outside of Borgarnes. We ate dinner at their on site restaurant, the Rock N’ Troll Café. It was great, and patrons had the opportunity to go through the café’s extensive vinyl collection and find something to play.

Day 15 – Reykjavik. On our last full day, after an awesome hotel breakfast we headed to Reykjavik. It was pride weekend, and we knew we’d miss the big parade happening the next day but thought we’d check out what was going on in the city. We had spent a couple of days exploring down-town on our first trip and this wasn’t a priority on this one. We found the building operating as Pride headquarters, and attended the LGBTQ+ craft market, which included several vendors from within the community. We walked around downtown for a little bit and went to the gift shop at Harpa which we’d remembered being one of our favourite souvenir spots. We then went to find and check into our hotel, Reykjavik Lights by Keahotels, which was a bit outside of downtown. We decided to spend some time at the closest public pool, which was Laugardarslaug. The complex had a regular lane swimming pool as well as a shallow kids pool with slides. There were several hotpots, and even a volleyball court. It was fairly busy but totally relaxing. For dinner, we found some delicious pho at Viet Express Food and then had ice cream from a place in the same plaza.

Day 16 – Departure. After a delicious hotel breakfast we went to the Reykjavik campground/hostel and left our remaining unopened groceries with someone at the office there. They were happy to take them for guests to use in the communal kitchen. It was close to the botanical gardens so we thought we’d walk around there for a bit but we still don’t know if it was just super unimpressive or we were just unable to find the main entrance! We weren’t up for getting wet before out flight but decided to check out Nautholsvik Geothermal Beach, and we’ve definitely added it to the list for future trips. There was one brave person swimming in the ocean and many people enjoying the hotpot on the beach. It looked great. Our last stop before the airport was to a park near the city to see one last waterfall – Kermoafoss. It was a quick 20 minute walk from where we parked, and along a lovely, easy, forested path. We returned our car to Blue about 3.5 hours before our flight and it was super easy. We’d opted for the full insurance so they didn’t have to inspect it for damages. We were able to check our bags, breeze through security, fill our carryons on with last-minute duty free souvenir purchases and grab a bite to eat and we still had lots of time before our 5 pm departure.

Final note: Truly, stay as flexible as you can. And embrace the unexpected! We lucked out with mostly amazing weather, but if we'd followed our original itinerary and waited on the south coast for the ring road to open up, we would have had some awfully messy days. I am sure we would have made the best of them, but we really did have the best time with those extra days up north.

I anticipate several future trips to Iceland. Now that we’ve had a taste of the entire country (except for that stretch between Hofn and Egilsstadir!) I anticipate future trips will each be focused on one region. There is still so much to see! I now devote a good portion of my brain to planning my next Iceland adventure, and it is a pretty fun, if expensive, hobby! Thanks to everyone here for all the great suggestions; this community has been so helpful.",6,1.0
Post,Some feedbacks from our visit,valer85,2024-09-09 11:36:58,"We visited last week, so end of august-beginning of september, and I thought it would be nice for future visitors to share some experience. 

- Scenery is breathtaking, sometimes it seems to be inside a fantasy movie. Google map time is just a rough idea, because you will stop at every corner to take photos.

- it's a good time of the year also for Aurora, it's just a matter of clouds. At 10.30 pm it's dark so if there are no clouds you have good chances to see it (if it's powerful enough). 

- Be prepared to change your itinerary or leave something behind. It's not always true (as I read before going there) that the weather can turn very fast from bad to good, it's more the other way around. We had 3 days of rain and it NEVER stopped. The clouds/fog made impossible to see anything, so we had to skip parts of the plan and drive back some days after.

- waterproof clothing: the problem for me was not the cold temperature nor the wind, but the rain. it's better to pay a bit more for real waterproof clothes than being wet during an entire hike. We bought waterproof goretex shoes at home (CMP and Columbia) and they were full of water after 10 minutes hike, and it was not even raining that much! Ridiculous! Salomon were a bit better but not a lot. So having a replacement pair for the rest of the day is really important. Consider that everything that's sold in the shops (locals or not) is crazy expensive.  

- tap water is free and good everywhere you go, no need to buy bottled water.

- speed limits are just on paper. I saw just a few tourists following them. locals don't follow them and overtake like in F1 races. 

- just a few puffins left in their main ""locations"" at the end of the month. low chance to see them but not zero. we chased them up to Westman Island, we took the ferry just for them and they did not disappoint us :)",1,2.0
Post,Late september - what can we expect?,__Ecstasy,2024-09-09 11:22:08,"Hi, we are yet another group going on a Ring Road road trip, from September 23rd - 30th.

We've gotten some ideas from research already, but we're very much inexperienced and we wanted to hear from this subreddit what we should expect in terms of:

- any cool **volcanic hikes** we can do?

- **F road closures.**.?

- **wildlife**? - I presume puffins will be gone by then, so we'll be able to see mostly sheep and seals?

- **ice glaciers/caves**? - is it still too early for this?

- and anything we should be aware of specifically for this time of the year, in terms of weather, campsites, driving, etc etc. And anything useful to bring, besides the obvious hiking/road trip gear.",0,7.0
Comment,,misssplunker,2024-09-09 11:37:44,"What do you mean with volcanic hikes? Hikes where you can see lava or magma? There's lava all over Iceland (except the West- and Eastfjords. Currently there's no ongoing eruption and the recent ones have not been tourist eruptions 

Given the weather we're having, I would assume most, if not all, F-roads would be closed or heavily restricted

The sheep are being gathered for réttir, so you're unlikely to see many roaming around. There will be some horses around and depending on where you're going, you might get a glimpse of reindeer, but most of the summer birds will be gone or leaving (incl. puffins)

They might be beginning to open, but it also might be too soon

There's ton of information on here about tips on driving, camping, weather etc. - Many campsites will be closed, so check before you head out, since there might be a long drive to the next open campsite",3,

Post,"See you again, Iceland!",unicorno07,2024-09-07 23:23:04,"We were extremely lucky, as the fresh volcano eruption just happened 1 week before our trip, and ended the day we left. We enjoyed the magnificent view very much!

We also felt we missed a lot, as we constantly need to fight with extreme weather. 3 out of 4 tours got cancelled. The blue ice cave tour got cancelled as it collapsed and killed one tourist right before our trip. The Jökulsárlón zodiac tour was cancelled due to strong wind. Failed to find the trace of puffin thanks to big fog. Got the volcano helicopter tour cancelled twice due to low cloud and visibility. Also I lost my drone, as I tried too hard to take a good recording on the volcano. I hiked the next day trying to find it, but then I stopped when I have lava crust in sight (See the attached image). I know it's a stupid thing, and I probably should not even hike at all, but at least I stopped, not as crazy as that guy, lol.... (I uploaded the cached low res footage from my drone)

Post,Trip Report August 19th - August 27th (long),dolphan013,2024-09-03 19:48:32,"Trip report August 19th - 27th (2nd try, guess I do not know how to post pics)

About us - 

Early 50's, in decent physical shape, we like to hike. We are not foodies and could care less about local cuisine. We brought freeze dried meals, peanut butter and instant coffee. We brought water bottles and drank the tap water.

I also plan way ahead of time and most of the days are planned and filled before we get there. I know a lot of people do not like planning like this but this is who I am and it works for us. I plan out ""must do's"" and ""like to do's"" so that if some or all of the ""like to do's"" are missed I am OK with it.

Having said that, the weather on the second day forced us to change things up a bit and it was a good thing our plan was to backtrack a bit as we were able to pick up some missed items later in the trip.  The plan was to go from Reykjavic to Vik to Hof then back to Hvolsvöllur then up to Geysir then to Keflavik.

Play Airlines -

I used Play Airlines out of Stewart Airport in NY. Check-in was smooth, they made a couple people measure their backpacks in the sizing boxes but it did not seem too strict with bag sizes. The people they had measure were those that looked like they packed their whole trip in their backpack.

Coming back they did not seem to care about bag sizes, there were a ton of people checking in so maybe they did not want to hold things up. Checkin went fast, they had all the booths manned which is rare in my experience.

Trying to sleep on Play flights is almost impossible. I've never been on a flight that only had pay for purchasing of food and no ""free"" service. People were ordering food the whole flight, the lights had to be kept on to facilitate this and the stewards were running back and forth constantly to take orders, cook and deliver food. It was chaos. I guess that is what a bargain airlines is like, it was my first time on an airlines such as this and I was not ready for it.

Parking -

I used Parka (and EasyPark once) for paid parking. I had turned on the Parka autopay feature and it did not work so I think I am going to get a fine or something for not paying at my first site or two as I forgot to check to see if it worked. Parka worked fine for manually paying for parking. At one stop (I cannot remember which one) Parka did not have an option for paying so I tried the EasyPark app and I was able to pay from that app.

Gas -

I used the Orkan tourist card added to my Google wallet to pay. I did not get gas at any other gas station. I filled up two and a half times. Fill up for a Rav4 was about $100 so we spent $250ish for the trip. We did a lot of driving though.

Driving -

I found highway 1 easy and non-stressful to drive. I did not see anything crazy going on with the overtaking (there are decent amount of people going between 70-80 on that road) and there are plentiful areas to overtake. There were a few people stopped on the side of the road but not as many as I thought there would be.

Driving Reykjavic - 

I did not do much of this but I found it a bit confusing as I was expecting STOP signs and did not see a single one. I google ""iceland stop signs"" and was always showed what basically looks like a US stop sign. I just ended up stopping/slowing down at every intersection where it was not obvious what to do.
The roundabouts I had previously researched and knew the inside lane had right of way, once you see others (probably locals) drive these roundabouts a couple times it really makes sense and is easy to adjust to.

Money -

I never say any Icelandic money. I paid with my credit card at most places. Google pay gave me trouble a couple times so I resorted to my wife's Apple Pay (which always worked) or my credit card.

Zero Car rental -

I got to ""Zero"" at about 5:30am, it's actually Blue, I did not even see a sign for Zero although it's on Google Maps. We walked there from the airport, about an 8 minute walk. They key lockbox did not open, I went to the counter (glad there was someone there that early) and they gave me a key. They did not really explain why the box didn't open, he tried telling me that I did not request it then when I showed him my email he shrugged and gave me a key.

When I returned the car she looked up that I had zero liability, smiled and took my key and said have a safe trip. I got two chips in the windshield, the first one happened before I even got to my first accommodations. No idea when the second occurred. Anyway, it was nice to not have had to worry about that.

Weather -

First day nice and sunny. Second day 50mph winds and rainy. The next few days were mostly cloudy and 55F then we had a sunny day followed by a rainy and cold day for the last day. The temps ranged from about 50F to 57F. Did not see much sun at all.

Clothes -

I run a lot warmer than my wife. I wore shorts on three or four of our days here. For my torso I had a shirt, a long sleeve light running shirt, a sweater and my rain/wind proof jacket. When I wore pants I also had wind/rain proof pants for my outer layer there. As everyone says - layers! The wind/rain proof outer layer is a must. I had a beanie for my head (and the hood from my jacket). My wife wore....well, girl stuff, I have no idea but she had layers of stuff that kept her kind of warm, she's cold when it's 65F so she was pretty much always cold. We also had water  resistant socks and hiking boots.

Day 1 -

-Checked into Hotel Reykjavik Grand.

-Hallgrimskirkja and Sun Voyager to kill some time before our ""Inside the Volcano Tour""

-Inside the Volcano tour (Arctic Adventures) - Awesome unique experience. Hiked to a dormant volcano and was lowered inside, we were left to run around in it for about 45 mins and then we left and hiked back out. They had arctic foxes there that they fed, very cute. This tour was VERY expensive but we were happy with what we got, a once in a lifetime experience.

-Bonus on way back to hotel for food

-Was going to explore Reykjavic more but hit a wall and crashed at 5pm

Day 2 - Terrible weather day for where we were headed (Vik). A lot of rain and 50-60mph gusts of wind. We changed things around a bit since we'd be back through this area in a couple days to adjust for the weather. Since we'd be wet we decided to do things that would get us wet anyways.

-Seljalandsfoss/Gljufrabui - amazing! crowded, got wet

-Skógafoss  - also amazing and crowded, originally was going to do about 5 miles of the Fimmvorduhals Trail (10 miles total) but could not because of the wind. got wet.

-Kvernufoss - also amazing, a lot less people, got wet

-Vik - Katla Wool Studio, bought some wool gear, products here seemed a LOT cheaper than the tourist shops, I am not sure if it's because the wool items sold here are not ""as good"" as the other shops or if it's because they are a small family run shop. My wife said the $500 sweaters at the tourist shops seemed thicker than the $150 sweaters we got at Katla but I am no wool sweater expert so I don't know if there really is a difference. I liked the sweaters we got and thought they were fine and it was also neat that they were actually making them in the shop itself.

-Smiðjan Brugghús (one of the few places we ate at), food was OK, beer was good.

-Víkurfjara Black Sand Beach, got wet

-Dyrhólaey Viewpoint, got wet

-Dyrhólaey Lighthouse, got wet

-Reynisfjara viewpoint - lots of puffins!  got wet

-stayed at Gotur cottages (a tiny home)

Day 3 -

-Reynisfjara Beach\Hálsanefshellir Cave

-Gígjagjá (Yoda Cave) - this was better than I expected, we were here early, not many people here.

-Mossy Lava Fields - the actual ""entrance"" to this seemed a little dangerous, even for our 4WD, so I just parked a bit of the way up and we walked around a little bit.

-Fjaðrárgljúfur viewpoint\Mogafoss - we went up the Froad 206 and saved an hour or two hiking by parking pretty much right next to this viewpoint. Did not want to hike because the weather was kinda of crappy again. This viewpoint is really great.

-Systrafoss - a short hike, not busy here

-Kirkjugólf Natural Monument

-Stjórnarfoss - short walk, no one here

-Dverghamrar

-Fossálar Waterfall - spent a bit of time here, it's really nice. Cooked up a couple backpacking meals here

-Diamond beach - west side is better for ""diamonds"". Did not see a lot of them but they were there.

-Jökulsárlón Glacier area - looked around, saw seals

-Svínafellsjökull Glacier - short walk to glacier, hardly anyone here, spectacular.

-stayed at Nonhamar Mini-Cottages (tiny home) for 2 nights

Day 4 -

-Zodiac Boat Tour on Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon (Ice Lagoon) - Loved this tour, they took us up to the glacier and we saw some pieces breaking off. Very informative guide, took lots of pictures.

-Viewpoint over Jökulsárlón

-Diamond Beach - went back because we saw there were tons of gigantic pieces of iceberg all over the beach. They were humongous, big enough for 3-4 people to climb on. What a great experience.

-Glacier hike/climb (Troll) - Really liked this tour, drove a bus to Svínafellsjökull Glacier, hiked in and they let us use ice axes and crampons to climb up the side of a glacier wall 3 times. Another very unique experience that we really enjoyed.

Day 5 -

-Svartifoss\Hundafoss hike, 3 miles I think

-Rauðárfoss

-Katla Wool Studio again to buy more wool stuff

-Víkurfjara Black Sand Beach again so we could see it in sunny weather

-ate at Ströndin • Pub - food was OK

-Kronan for grocery refresh, this place was a zoo, maybe because of nearby campground?

-Sauðafoss - a little ways up a crappy Froad

-Nauthúsagil - down another Froad, this was a cool hike, we only went to first falls, were not in the mood to get our feet soaked again.

-Íráfoss

-stayed at Seljalandsfoss Horizons, super expensive tiny home. picked this only because of proximity to attractions and the fact we were backtracking and I did not want to drive too far in one day.

Day 6 -

-Urriðafoss - well worth a short stop if you are driving by, a fairly angry waterfall and only takes a few minutes to see

-Gulfoss - we got here kind of early, wasn't too busy but still a lot of people. A nice gift shop here.

-Brúará Trail - 4 miles out and back, saw Hlauptungufoss, Miðfoss and Brúarfoss. water here is an incredible blue. This place really stood out for me because of this.

-ate at Efstidalur II, the reviews were really good on this place but I found the burgers meh and the ice cream nothing special. Maybe I just do not know good food.

-Kerid Crater - neat to see, we walked around the bottom and top.

-Geysir - severely underwhelming. Maybe because I've been to Yellowstone? Strokkur Geyser was erupting for like .5 seconds at a time, not even long enough to take a photo. Maybe I just went at a bad time. The gift shop seemed like 20% more expensive than any other gift shop I had been to. I did not spend much time on the golden circle so maybe that is why it was so expensive.

-stayed at Litli Geysir hotel, nice and clean, very simple and cheap. Hung out and had a few drinks, we were winding down by this point with the end of our trip in sight.

Day 7 -

-Þórufoss

-Hvammsvik Nature resort & Hot Springs - had a 10am appointment (the first). Very few people here at the start. We got the package that allowed for the private changing room/showers but it was not policed and anyone could just do what they wanted so I could have saved a few dollars here. My wife said none of the women were showering nude (again, no policing) and I'm only adding that info because I know a lot of people ask about this. They give out bracelets for lockers and to purchase drinks. My wife and I really liked it here. They had various pools of all different temps and you could hop in the ocean for a cold plunge. we tried all the pools (I think) and I also cold plunged, it felt really great. We bought a few drinks here (at about $10 a drink). We finally had a nice sunny day again since the first day we got here and enjoyed ourselves for a couple of hours.

-Drove back to Reykjavic so I could get a tattoo. We explored the Rainbow Road a little bit (my tattoo was right off this road) and was underwhelmed with the touristy shops and the restaurants. We are not big on cities in general and this just reinforced why but we were only here really because I wanted to get a tattoo here otherwise we probably would have found something in nature to do.

-Drove to our hotel in Keflavik with the intent to go back out and grab up some eruption sightings but we ended up having a few too many drinks and decided to check the eruption out in the morning (which ended up being a mistake).

-stayed at Lighthouse Inn, affordable simple hotel.

Day 8 -

-We had a flight at 4pm, had planned on going to a couple touristy spots and checking out the eruption. The weather had turned to crap and the visibility was garbage. We went to 5 different view spots and could see the eruption but not very well. In retrospect we should have went back out the night before because the weather was clear and we saw that people had posted clear pictures of the eruption with the aurora and we missed out on this. I really regretted this decision. Keep in mind if you have clear/sunny skies it probably wont last and don't squander that time sitting in a hotel and drinking =)

-We ended up at the airport way to early for our flight but had run out of things to do with the weather so it was what it was. We had our first hot dogs in Iceland here, wasn't a big fan, they were OK. I think as an American I am just too used to super salty hot dogs and these did not fit that bill. Also as an American, the mustard here isn't ""yellow mustard"" it's more like a honey mustard.

-Flight was on time and we got home a bit early. The boarding process was another new thing for me. We went out to the tarmac on busses and they had two sets of stairs leading up to the plane, one in the front and one in the back. Seemed a bit chaotic to me and I have no idea how they got a woman in a wheelchair in that plane.

Can't wait to go back and explore the North!",14,4.0

Post,Observations from an American ,dfibslim,2024-08-29 23:23:23,"Currently on a 12 day ring road trip from America and have a few observations to share. 

The food at gas stations are really good. I'm used to only having the option of nachos, frozen burritos, or other junk foods.

Also not used to paying for public restrooms. Frustrating when I pay to use it and they are out of soap or paper towels. 

I'm also surprised with the lack of top sheets on the beds. I apologize to the hotel staff for taking the comforter out and just sleeping with the liner.

I'm also in my 40s and was the first time showering in a communal shower at the baths.

Post,My full review of my an Iceland solo trip,NoDentureAdventure,2024-08-29 15:51:27,"I just got done with my 4 day solo trip to Iceland and would like to help anyone else who is doing research for their trip. For context, I’m 27 and from the US and visited in August 2024. Some things may interest me more than you and that’s ok. 

**Disclaimer:** some of this will be anti-tourist. I understand that I’m also a tourist. But I feel a lot of tourist destinations involve loud and unaware visitors that I don’t enjoy. 

**Driving:** I rented my car from **Lotus**. They offered the cheapest price for a fully insured vehicle. I would recommend getting all of the insurance as the weather here is wild. Driving is not very difficult here but there are some things I wish I knew ahead of time. Driving in Reykjavík is a headache. It is a car hostile city and pedestrians rule the road (from a US perspective). This is a great feature of the city but made driving somewhat anxiety inducing.  The top speed on the island is 90km/hr (62mph) which feels slow. I would not recommend speeding as fines here are astronomically high. I’d recommend looking up road signs prior to arriving as they are very different than the US

**Housing:** I stayed all 4 nights at the **Loft Hostel**. It’s a great location within the city. There’s a bar and small restaurant on the top floor. This makes it easy to meet new people. It’s a bit noisy at night with the popular street outside and the bar on top and there aren’t a ton of bathrooms. I would probably have booked a private bathroom if I did it again. 

**Prices:** the prices weren’t crazy unless it came to food. Expect $20-30 per meal. There were a few times I got a burger, fries, and a beer and it brought my total to $40. Definitely my biggest expense. I didn’t bring any cash with me and only used my card so don’t worry about exchanging a ton of currency.

**Day 1: Reykjavik**

**Walking tour:** most European cities offer a free walking tour and I wouldn’t skip this one. This was the highlight of the day as our tour guide was wonderful and explained a lot about the history and culture of Iceland. They will ask for tips at the end but I think this is only fair for a free service. 

**Hallgrimskirkja:** it’s the big church and it’s impossible to miss. It’s got cool architecture and pipes. It’s free to visit into until you take the elevator. It’s about $10 (1381IKR) to ride up to the top and see the city from its high point. I personally wasn’t impressed with the view so I would not pay this again. 

**Day 2: Nature/Central and East**

**Silfra Fissure diving:** this is the only spot in the world in which you can swim between two tectonic plates. It’s advertised as a top 5 adventure in the world and I believe it. Genuinely one of the coolest experiences I’ve ever had and would recommend it to everyone. I went snorkeling and it’s about $160 (22.100IKR) and takes probably 2 hours from suit on to suit off. 

**Thingvellir National Park:** this gives a great view of the fissure and the island’s largest lake. Very pretty views. I was hoping for a decent hike but this was probably a 30 minute paved trail with a lot of tourists in the middle stopping to take photos. 

**Strokkur Geyser:** a very underwhelming experience which may be a hot take. It seems to erupt every 5 minutes or so and the water goes to around 30 feet in the air perhaps. This just didn’t interest me and I would probably say it’s worth skipping. Also had a ton of people there being very disruptive which dampened my experience. 

**Brúarfoss:** It’s Iceland’s bluest waterfall and probably 30 minutes worth of time. People get really close to the waterfall which can be dangerous. People have died very recently from doing this. $5 (690IKR) parking. 

**Öxarárfoss:** very cool waterfall with some interesting rocks to look at. There seemed to be some camp sites nearby if that interests you. $7 (1.000IKR) parking

**Þórufoss:** also probably my favorite waterfall. It’s very remote but easy to get to. There wasn’t a single person here and the waterfall is MASSIVE. Highly recommend. 

**Helgufoss:** the highlight of this waterfall would be the horses that are just chilling here. You can walk right up to them and snap a pic. Don’t touch them though. 

**Day 3: Whale Watching/Cultural Night**

**Elding Whale Watching:** a very unique experience that I’m glad I tried. It’s a lot like fishing where nothing happens for a bit and then the action starts. Saw about 6 whales which isn’t a guarantee that you’ll see one. Most of the time they are just coming up for air so don’t expect a huge eruption. It is very cold and windy out there so bundle up. Probably wouldn’t go a second time. It costs about $136 (18.700IKR) and took 3 hours. 

**Cultural Night:** I didn’t want to spend much time in Reykjavik after my first night but once a year the city shuts down many roads for their biggest festival of the year. Lots of live music, art, food, and drinks. It made me really appreciate the city more and all of its people. I also ran in the marathon and all of the locals came out to cheer which was very nice and felt like they had a great community. Might be a result of the festival, but it was impossible to go to a restaurant without a reservation so it may be worth making one if you have a particular place you’d like to eat at during your stay.

**Day 4: South Island**

**Seljalandsfoss:** very popular and large waterfall. The coolest part is that you can walk behind the water. This place gets very very busy but if you go early/late in the day then it’s not too bad. $7 (1.000IKR) parking

**Gljúfrabúi:** in the same parking lot as Seljalandsfoss, this waterfall is between some cliffs. A little harder to get close to unless you want to walk through the water and get soaked.

**Kvernufoss:** one of my favorite waterfalls that is about a 15 minute walk by a small creek. You also get to go behind this one but it’s not as much water. Very few people during my visit

**Skógafoss:** possibly the most famous waterfall and for good reason. This one is massive and gorgeous. If you come on a sunnier day then there’s a pretty rainbow that often appears on the water. There’s also a large staircase you can walk to the top of the waterfall but I didn’t do this because my knees were shot from the day before

**Dyrhólaey:** I didn’t see much chatter about this but happened to drive upon this. It overlooks the black sand beach and Atlantic ocean. Beautiful views. It’s probably 400 feet so be careful if there are high winds. There’s a lighthouse to visit from the outside. I saw my first puffin here as well.

**Reynisfjara Beach:** this is where I really started getting Game of Thrones vibes. The rock formations here just don’t look real and this is a must see. High tourist destination so a lot of people climbing on the rocks. There were about a million puffins here which was cool. Puffins were shitting all over. It may have been the weather, but there are a lot of whales that can be spotted about 100 meters from the shore.

**Vik:** can’t say too much about Vik because I stopped here for food (pizza had cream cheese on it which was surprisingly good) but it seems like a cute town

**Þakgil:** this would be a mandatory stop for me if I were to come again. A beautiful and remote camp site with a 9 mile trail to hike. There is a glacier waterfall that you can swim in even if it is freezing. Truly surreal sights that I hope I never forget. Þakgil is probably my biggest recommendation if you are going to Iceland

**Regrets?** Staying in Reykjavik every night. I would have preferred to have different hotels throughout the island or to have camped. This made going to the eastern and northern parts of the island to be difficult from a time standpoint. Also regret not going to the geothermal pools. Not the lagoons but the pools. The locals love them and they’re also way cheaper than the lagoons

Post,Beware of bringing Iceland weather back,Perenially_behind,2024-08-28 23:07:26,"We spent a wonderful couple of weeks in Iceland recently. The weather didn't always cooperate, but we live in an area that is often foggy and drizzly (though not as windy) so we dressed accordingly and took it in stride

However, it seems that we brought Iceland weather back with us! August is usually the sunny month in western Washington State but the week since we got back has been cool, gray, and wet. 

So check your luggage carefully before returning and make sure that nobody snuck bits of bad weather in. I suspect the stuffed puffin my wife bought for her brother as a thank-you for watching our cat while we were gone. 

He is back home now. I'm not saying that elves are behind this, but if you read about a mysterious cold and drizzly snap in southern Arizona, well, draw your own conclusions. ",50,13.0
Post,Kid-friendly nice restaurant in Reykjavík ,eemey,2024-08-28 22:24:08,"Hi! On our final night in Iceland we want to go out for a nice dinner — but we’ll be bringing with our 3 year old so would likely not want to do traditional fine dining like Dill/OX.

I’m not particularly choosy about type of cuisine or the cost, we just don’t want to end up at a chain restaurant or somewhere kitschy that serves puffin and whale to tourists.

For an example of what we’re looking for, we really enjoyed Gott in Westman Islands and felt super comfortable there as a family with a small kiddo.

Sorry if this request is too vague! I’ve just really struggled to find this particular good-but-not-fancy kind of place in Reykjavik.

This might be overkill but get the eBird app / make account / tap Explore / tap upper right settings and change to 1 day or 3 days / tap the green fire icon to change to species search / enter Atlantic Puffin to see latest sightings. Some of the locations will even include the precise gps coordinates. This is what it shows currently for last 3 days.

Post,"6 days in Iceland Report (Reykjavík, Snaefellsnes, Golden Circle, Southern Iceland, Vík, Hofn) ",totodomination,2024-08-25 18:33:54,"Hi everyone! I had a really amazing anniversary trip with my bf and throughly enjoyed planning it. I made a very ambitious itinerary and ended up having to cut some things, especially since I got sick for half the trip. But honestly, I'm happy to report that we still did a lot and I'm happy with the results! Hope this itinerary helps! Our travel dates were Aug 15-20. We had about 16 hrs of sunlight a day so that was great! 

COSTS
In total, we spent about 5k since my travel points covered the flights. The majority of the expenses were spent towards hotels (1.3k), car ($500 rental, $430 gas, $65 for a wifi box), activities (blue lagoon $300 for a slightly upgraded entry, $312, lava show $73, museum $65, parking at paid sites $40), necessary clothing bought prior (about $600), and food (around $350).We only ate out like 5 times and saved a lot with included hotel breakfasts and by doing two Bonus grocery runs to make sandwiches otw to destinations. It also helped us save time on busy exploration days! Groceries were $180. We bought a cooler for $35 before the trip! We spent about $300 on miscellaneous things like souvenirs. 


DAY 1 - ARRIVAL & BLUE LAGOON 

We arrived on a rainy day at about 9am from NYC. Picked up our car rental from Icerental4x4. Got a mini SUV in case of weather issues or rough roads ahead. We went to Kökulist bakery and had amazing lox sandwiches and coffees. We headed to the Blue Lagoon, a good activity for a rainy day! It was really helpful because i actually had a left leg cramp for the whole 6 hrs of the flight 😩 caught no sleep) We spent a lot longer here than anticipated and only had time to do a Bónus grocery run- we were going to explore Reykjavík after our hotel check in at Reykjavík Marina but we were honestly way too tired from the jet lag. We decided to squeeze some in tomorrow before heading to Snaefellsnes Peninsula. 

Side note - i picked this hotel because there is a free parking zone 3 blocks away and was easy to find. Be aware of the varied parking zones and prices around downtown if you are driving. 

DAY 2 - REYKAVIK & SNAEFELLSNES 

This day was jam packed and we ended our night by midnight, in part because my Icelandic friend was available to spend the day with us! I should have booked two nights in the capital since I had to drop him back, silly me. I had met him while backpacking in 2018 and was happy to see him again. 

Anyways- we spent the morning in Reykjavík, where we walked to the Harpa Concert Hall and my friend texted to meet him at Hallgrimskirkja, which was perfect! We then went to the Phallological Museum on the way back to the car. (my bf said this was a priority for him on this trip so i had to make this happen since we didnt get to go on Day1 😅) we left Reykjavík at noon. 

Snaefellsnes Peninsula - what a fantastic adventure. We got to Kirkjufellsfossar to view Kirkjufell Mountain at about 3pm. I'm a big GOT buff so this was a must! One of the top things I wanted to do was drive an F road (which you need a 4WD for, i believe some other F roads you need a 4x4), and I read online that the F570 is beautiful to drive-plus you can view the Snaefellsnjokull glacier! And omg, it's like a mini version of the Highlands, according to my friend. There were beautiful red, yellow, green and brown colors in the landscapes. It was also so much fun to drive and spent about an hr since we kept making stops for photos and viewpoints.

We then drove to Djúpalónssandur - it's more like a black pebble beach than a black sand beach. It was ok, I just liked the rock formations. We were here for like an hour because my friend got hyper focused on skipping pebbles over a lake there haha. I was looking for the Lóndrangar View point but ended up at the Malarrif Lighthouse by lovely accident. We did go afterwards! We made some quick stops and got some beautiful sunset photos in Hellnar, Arnarstapi, and at the Budir black church. Wish we had time to catch some seals at Ytri Tunga and to see the Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge, but by the end of Budir it was already 9pm and i still had to drop off my friend in Reykjavík while our hotel was in Borgarnes (Hotel Hamar). Yes, that drop off added 2 hrs to the 2hr drive that night. We got to the hotel at 12:40am 😭 But catching up with an old friend is worth it! He had some great icelandic stories and narration for us. 

Side note - we were so fortunate to see arctic foxes 4 times! My friend said he's never seen so many in a day... Perhaps they are becoming reliant on tourists for food - don't feed them, our food is too salty for their digestive tracts and they will forget how to hunt by the time winter comes and then they will die of starvation... Just saying. 

DAY 3 - GOLDEN CIRCLE

Worst thing that can happen - I woke up with the most painful sore throat ever. I was sneezing and had a runny nose. We were so mad that the person sitting behind us on the plane was severely symptomatic and was not wearing a mask. At least we woke up to some stunning views in Hotel Hamar. 

I tried to be a trooper for the Golden Circle, but I couldn't keep going after Thingvellir National Park and kept having to stop just to breathe. We had also gotten lost trying to look for parking lot 3 so we ended up going to p2 for the Öxarárfoss waterfall and p1 for the fault line to make it easier on me. You only need to pay for parking once by the way! FYI, you can easily spend 1-3hrs here depending on how much you want to do it see in this park. We got lunch at Efstidalur (which was amazing, according to my bf the ice cream was super delicious. I couldn't indulge with a sore throat :/ ) and a Bónus run in Selfoss (we had eaten most of the groceries already during our busy day in Snaefellsnes yesterday lol) before going to the hotel in Vik. We spent the night in Hotel Katla - for some reason our room was super hot so we had to leave a window open all night. Would have loved to use their hot tub to help clear my sinuses but it was full due to a birthday party. 

I had so much planned originally (geysir, gullfoss waterfall, kerid Crater, a dinner reservation at Ingólfsskáli Viking Restaurant, maybe see the Keldur Turf House). What a bummer. 
Side note - I'm thinking if we are ever fortunate enough to add a few days stop over in Iceland, we can do this next time. Through Icelandair, you can add between 1-7 days stop over if you're flying with them to Europe. 

Another side note - make sure you pack enough cold meds! Apparently cold meds aren't really a thing to Icelanders lol. I packed enough for a few days but if my bf had also gotten sick, we would have been screwed. I had packed mucinex, dayquil, nightquil, and some nasal decongestants that were very helpful. 

DAY 4 - JÖKULSÁRLÓN & DIAMOND BEACH 

I really need to sleep in and recover so we ended up doing our morning plans to go to the Reynisfjara beach and Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon later in the trip when I was feeling better. We drove 2hrs straight to Jökulsárlón for our 3hr Blue Cave Tour at 1pm - this was at the top of my to do list given the global warmth melting the glaciers quickly. It was GORGEOUS. We had a pretty boring tour guide that you could barely hear and the ride to and from was a majority of the tour time... We were only in the glacier for maybe a half an hour. Still worth the journey though! Wish our time viewing the glacier from the inside were longer. They lend you crampons for your shoes to walk in the glacier by the way, so no need to buy them. 

Afterwards, we took our time at the lagoon to see the glacier fragments floating down to the ocean and even spotted some seals! We also drove to the other parking lot to see Diamond beach, where those pieces of glaciers end up when the tide pushes then. It's really cool to see on the black sand! By the way, you only have to pay for parking once and you can go to any of their parking lots for the day. No need to walk all the way down to the beach like I saw some people crossing the bridge.

We drove an hr to Hofn to check into Milk Factory. We were suprised by the beautiful mountain views from our hotel room! 
After, we went to Otto Matur & Drykkur for dinner. It's a small, family run restaurant (about twelve tables) They literally live on the second floor. The line was out the door after we were sat down immediately at 7:30p! The atmosphere was marvelous and service was superb. I thought the food was a little salty but my bf loved it. 

DAY 5 - HOFN TO VÍK 

Finally, my cold was clearing up and I was able to hug my bf! Imagine an anniversary trip where you can't be too close cuz of sickness? Sheesh. 
After breakfast, we headed to Stokknes. The winds were BRUTAL and it HURTS when the sand hits your skin! Make sure to be covered from head to toe, even wear sunglasses if it's cloudy. Hold onto those car doors for dear life!!! Last thing you want is for the wind to rip them off cuz it has happened! It was kind of cool to see, but I'm not sure if it ended up being worth the additional drive despite my well traveled friend recommended going. The Viking Village was subpar. It was a long wait at the Viking Cafe to get entry tickets, even though the line was not long. We spent here 1.75hr in Stokknes. 

We stopped at the Svínafellsjökull Glacier tongue on the way to Vík. The shapes were really cool to see! Took us an hr. We made a quick stop at Lómagnúpur to view the rock mountain. Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon about an hour long hike total with beautiful views. Highly recommend it. Our timing was impeccable, we expected rain much earlier but it started to on the way back down to the car. 

Some stops that I would have loved to make were the Viewpoint of Fjallsjökull, Mulagljufur Canyon, Hofskirkja turf house church, and the Svartifoss waterfall at Skatafell national park... But we didnt have time since we had a 7pm lava show reservation back in Vik. It was actually well worth it! We had a great host for the show and was very informative. The lava show itself was impressive but gets super hot! Luckily the rain cleared up be the end of the show at 8pm so we took the opportunity to catch the sunset over Reynisfjara black sand beach. My gosh, what an amazing place to be during the sunset. The rock formations on the east side of the beach are super cool. And we got to see puffins!!! We ended the night with checking into Hotel Kría. 

DAY 6 - VIK TO THE AIRPORT 

Our last day in Iceland! What a bummer, but also a perfect final day in Iceland. We had a flight at 7:50pm so we aimed to drop off the car by 5pm. After breakfast in the hotel, we made a quick stop to Vík i Myrdal Church for a viewpoint over Vik. We then drove about half an hour to Dyrhólaey's lower parking lot for a view of the beach. There is another upper parking lot to drive up to for the Dyrhólaey Lighthouse. Omg, we got to see puffins up close!!! They burrow right on the side of the Dyrhólaey cliffs and they see super cute. We spent more time than anticipated here because of the puffins, lol. We spent 1.5hrs total here in Dyrhólaey and left arround noon. 

Make sure to have your waterproof jacket and pants on. It gets wet at Skógafoss, Seljalandsfoss, and Gljufrabui! We saw a double rainbow in Skógafoss! When you get up to the waterfall, it becomes a rainbow circle... Kind of crazy. We didn't have enough time to go to the upper viewpoint of this waterfall. We drove half an hour to the Seljalandsfoss. Yes we did get to walk behind it and it gets SUPER COLD, oh my goodness. But really awesome. I didn't quite enjoy going into Gljufrabui about a ten min walk away... There are too many tourists trying to get in and out of such a cramped space at once. You'd think people would be smarter and patient about it. We waited for enough people to exit before entering but others after us didn't, so it was hectic. Make sure you wear your waterproof boots in here- you'll be stepping in plenty of water when there aren't enough rocks to stand on. 

Lastly, we headed back to the airport. Got to the rental place by 5:20 but still made it to our flight with plenty of time to get some last minute souvenirs! 


THE END :(

This trip was amazing and wish we had more time and money to see more. Hope my advice, tips, and experience, will be helpful to anyone planning to go! If I were to redo the trip, maybe i would have cut out Hofn in our plans and only gone as far as Jökulsárlón to have less driving time that could have been used to see the sites we missed along the south. But I really wanted to try that restaurant so that part was worth it I guess! What I miss the most in terms of food are actually the grocery sandwiches we made during the trip - their edelbeikon, roast pork, and lamb cold cuts are SUPER GOOD, their butter is SUPERB, and the Icelandic flatbread is DELICIOUS. Their dairy products are definitely superior since all their livestock are actually free roaming. Kinda crazy how you can taste the difference. 

Feel free to ask me questions, I'm more than happy to help. Thank you to the reddit community for having helped me plan this trip too! And thanks to anyone who took the time to read my trip report.",80,24.0

Comment,,Remote_Antelope_8601,2024-08-25 11:44:23,"Westman Islands. There’s literally thousands of them thru middle of September. We were just there last week and it took our breath away. Easy ferry ride from the south coast of Iceland. Plus it’s the season when the pufflings have hatched and are lost and kids (and adults) all over the island trying to find and release pufflings back to sea. It’s amazing.

Post,DETAILED REPORT OF OUR 12 DAYS IN ICELAND,inostrale,2024-08-23 18:20:35,"We just came back from our 12 day trip to Iceland and I thought I'd share our itinerary, expenses, and experience. There aren't going to be any pictures, I don't recommend reading this if you're looking for inspiration, this might just be useful if you're about to embark on a similar journey so you know what you could expect. This is not a guide either, as we actually made a few mistakes.

**DISCLAIMERS**

Feel free to skip this part if you're just interested in what we did, and not why we did it.

**A lot of driving.** 2778 kilometers or 1726 miles to be specific. We hit the ring road (route 1) which allows you to circle the whole island, with several detours. Some of these were worth it, others not so much (in our humble and personal opinion).

Roadtripping is our favourite way of travelling, so it was a no-brainer for us to go this route. If you hate driving, I suggest booking tours from Reykjavik, you can easily hit all the main attractions in Iceland on a tour bus without renting a car. If you like driving, but you don't love it, I think sticking to the ring road without detours is the way to go.

Also note we found driving in Iceland to be very relaxing, even on F roads (dirt roads you are only allowed to drive on with a 4X4 car. We had a Dacia Duster and had no problems whatsover, but also keep in mind we never ventured into the most difficult tracks where you have to cross rivers, among other things).

**We crammed a lot in.** The downside to this is that we never spent more than 2 hours at each attraction (with a couple of exceptions) as we had to be on the move all the time.

The reason for this is that when we visit a new country we try to see as much as possible simply because we will probably never return to it. Not because we don't want to, it's just that the urge to see somewhere new is stronger. We obviously didn't see everything as it would take a lifetime and more, we built our itinerary around a simple rule: we tried to see the most satifying things with as little effort as we could make.

We talked with several fellow travelers along the way who had an entirely different approach: they skipped a lot of attractions and spent at least half a day at each place they visited. While in hindsight I'm happy with the way our itinerary turned out, I also admit some places we visited definitely deserved more time to take it all in.

**We traveled frugally.** I will break down the costs in the next section, but let me preface it by saying that we had a somewhat tight budget, and this affected all of our expenses, in particular food. I'm not ashamed to say we ate a lot of sandwiches (pre-made at the shop or buying smoked salmon and bread), hot dogs, canned tuna. Yes, you heard that right. We ate out 5 times in total (I'll go into details later).

I'm going to be honest, while we don't regret what we did, towards the end of the trip we started to feel that our bodies needed more variety in our diets, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. As for me, if I could go back, I would just make sure to bring a couple of vitamin supplements with us. Bonus was obviously our preferred grocery store to go to.

**COSTS**

Before even setting foot in Iceland, my partner and I had already spent 1795€ each.  
This amount included the following:

* Flight ticket to and from Keflavik (closest international airport to Reykjavik) with one piece of hand-on baggage and one piece of checked luggage (maximum weight: 20 kilos) included. Airline: PLAY Airlines. We flew from continental Europe.
* Parking for 12 days at the parking lot near the airport where we left our car for the trip.
* Travel insurance in case we canceled our trip (86€ each).
* Bus tickets from Keflavik to Reykjavik on the day of arrival and from Reykjavik to the Airport on the return date (61€ each). We chose Flybus, which is the go to company for airport transfers.
* Car rental for 10 full days (680€ total, 340€ each).
* Accomodation. This was obviously the most onerous expense. A couple of notes:

1. When we booked the hotels in January, we noticed there was a steep price to pay to go from a single room at a guesthouse with a shared bathroom, to a single room at a guesthouse with a private bathroom. The average mark-up for the private bathroom was about 90€ at each place, I'm not kidding. For this reason we opted for a shared-bathroom, private-room solution for almost every night.
2. We spent on average 130€ per night. Notice that this cost was split in half between me and my partner. If you're solo traveling accomodation is going to be particularly pricey, but you can keep your expenses lower by booking at hostels. We ourselves were tempted to do this, but in the end we chose to spend a little more for intimacy.

Once in Iceland, I personally spent 637€ over the course of 12 days. Cash is pretty much non-existent in Iceland, so it was very easy to calculate the final amount looking at my debit card transactions. This includes:

* Eating out 5 times.
* A lot of grocery shopping (see the frugality notice above).
* Whale-watching tour (60-70€ each, I'll explain more later).
* Fuel (split between my partner and I).
* Souvenirs (60€, only small items as I had limited space in my baggage).
* Parking at tourist attractions. If you didn't know, in Iceland you don't pay to see natural wonders, you pay for a parking spot near them. I highly reccomend installing the Parka app, it makes paying parking fees very easy, but also notice there's a few places where you cannot use this app. I think the price for parking was extremely low for what you get in return, but if you visit a lot of places as we did, this cost adds up quickly.

**Total cost: 2432€.**

**ITINERARY**

**Day 1**

We arrived at Reykjavik late at night, meaning we did no exploration on the first day. I'm still including it as it took a long time for us to get from our home to the hotel, so I would say it was definitely part of the trip. If you're curious, here's the detailed journey:

* Our home --> Parking lot near the airport by car
* Parking lot near the airport --> airport itself by shuttle
* Airport --> plane terminal by bus
* Plane terminal --> Keflavik airport terminal by plane
* Keflavik airport terminal --> Keflavik airport entrance by bus
* Keflavik airport entrance --> Reykjavik downtown by Flybus
* Reykjavik downtown --> our hotel by Flybus shuttle

This might sound like we wasted a day and could have landed directly in the morning, but we decided to get to Reykjavik at night on purpose, so we could get 8 hours' sleep and wake up in the morning full of energies and ready for the adventure ahead.

**Day 2**

We spent the morning exploring Reykjavik. It's a small capital, and if I'm going to be honest, it's skippable if you don't have a lot of days for your trip to Iceland. The highlight here obviously is the gothic church and its pipe organ inside (the metal design of which clashes with the architecture of the church). I also heard the Lava Show is very good.

We had decided to spend half a day visiting Reykjavik, and in the afternoon, after taking our rental car, go to either the Blue Lagoon or the Sky Lagoon, but it was a sunny day, and the simplicity of Reykjavik, its laid-back vibe, filled us with so much serenity we parked our rental car next to the hotel and just wandered around town.

This is one of two changes of schedule over the course of our trip, and while we don't regret spending more time in Reykjavik, this decision in particular came back to bite us in the ass on our last day, as I'll explain later.

**Day 3**

We hit the road early in the morning on our way to the **Golden Circle**. This area is a short drive from Reykjavik and due to its proximity to the capital, and the short distance between its famous attractions, is possibly one of the busiest areas of the country. If you include it to your itinerary, I think you can use it as a gauge to evaluate how many tourists you will find on the rest of your trip: it's unlikely you'll find as many people as in the Golden Circle. Note that all the places we visited along the Golden Circle are within 5 minute walking distance from the parking lot.

Our first stop was **Þingvellir National Park**. You have to pay for parking, and you cannot use the Parka app.  
The park has good infrastructure, with a lot of parking space, facilities, and a marked circuit to follow. We spent a couple of hours there. We also visited the waterfall, which we found stunning right then, but in hindsight, it was the least impressive waterfall we saw. We don't regret visiting the park, but to be blunt, while the idea of walking in between two tectonic plates sounds amazing conceptually, aesthetically it was put to shame by the size and scale of what we saw later on.

Then we moved on to **Brúarárfoss**. This was a mere 30 minute stop for us, but totally worth it. A lot of waterfalls in Iceland impressed us for their sheer power, but this one is more delicate, elegant, and obviously the allure lies in the bright light blue color of its waters. Paid parking (Parka).

Next, we went to **Strokkur Geyser**. The busiest area of all. Surprisingly free parking. We spent approximately one hour looking at the geysers and the sulfate minerals in the area. What can I say, for us, as we had never seen an erupting geyser before, it was totally awe-inspiring. I've watched videos of Yellowstone, and if you've been there, probably Stokkur is going to be a little underwhelming in comparison.

Only a 10 minute drive is **Gullfoss**. Again, free parking, we spent about 40 minutes in this area. This is one of those places (and there are many of them in Iceland) the grandeur of which cannot be captured by pictures. While it wasn't raining (yet it was a cloudy day) we had to put our raincoats on as the spray of the waterfall can get you soaking wet in a couple of minutes.

Our last stop was **Kerið**. This is a privately owned property, and the owner allows visitors to see the volcano crater for a fee (you cannot use Parka here). While we saw bigger volcano craters in the following days, this one remains a highlight of Iceland for me. Reason being you can hike all around the crater rim, and also, you can descend to get a view of the lake in the middle and see the crater from below. We spent about 1 hour there.

Then we drove all the way south of Selfoss (a small town) where he spent the night at a guesthouse in the middle of nowhere.

We were tired, but so overstimulated from all the sights we had admired that day, that we couldn't sleep, so we hopped on our car after dinner and went to **Knarrarós Lighthouse**.

The lighthouse itself was closed, but we hiked further on to the shore where we saw the ocean waves washing against a patch of natural rock pools. There was no one in sight. While I don't particularly recommend going to this place, if you have some extra time to spare, I do suggest venturing into some lesser known places where you're less likely to encounter a lot of people at least once.

We came to Iceland for the big natural wonders, and they were totally worth it, but we found the unnamed secluded landscapes and the rare sights of sun to be just as beautiful.

**DAY 4**

We woke up early, earlier than we had wished for, but our hearts were racing and our feet were restless.

We started the day with a detour: **Haifoss**. This was more than an hour's drive from our guesthouse, and even more from our next scheduled destination.

Maybe it was the partially clear sky with fat grey clouds coloring the crestlines in the landscape different hues, maybe it was the land around us starting to look less like Earth, and more like Mars, maybe it was because it was so early we didn't meet anyone along the road, in any case this was possibly the most atmospheric drive of our drip.

Admittedly, we only spent about 20 minutes at the waterfalls. Other than us, only 2 more people were there. We noticed there was a hike that supposedly led at the feet of the waterfalls, but we didn't have enough time for that. We drove back to the coast on a different route, an F road, the rockiest and shakiest of our trip. We drove past the left turn that would have taken us to Landmannalaugar. We knew it was hard to get to, and as I said earlier, our intenton was to see most of the island making as little effort as possible, so we skipped it entirely. Still, we got a little taste of the otherworthly landscape you can expect to encounter in that area by just driving south back to route 1. Free parking for Haifoss.

It started to rain as we reached **Seljalandsfoss**. This was the most ""Instagram vs reality"" moment of our trip.  
It was a lot more packed than social media would have you believe, and we had to wait in a car line as the parking lot was full. The main allure of the waterfall is the fact that you can walk behind it. Now, I never complain about huge crowds when I travel simply because I'm well aware I'm part of that crowd, but when you cannot take a single step without anyone giving you annoyed looks because you got in the way of their perfect picture, that's when the crowd kind of ruins the experience for me.  
A short walk from Seljalandsfoss takes you to neighbooring Gljufrabui, a very picturesque waterfall because it is inside a cove. As we made our way there, we realized there was a queue to get into the cove, so we just decided to skip it. Overall, we spent about 1 hour in this area. Paid parking (Parka).

We checked in at our guesthouse west of Vik, and then drove to **Reynisfjara**. I will say this is one of the few places in Iceland that wears its best dress when it's cloudy (and rainy, in our case): the dramatic towering black rocks emerging from the ocean, the pitch black sand, the cove covered in basalt columns, it all stands out more on a grey day, giving off ominous and eerie vibes. Even with the huge crowds, it was the highlight of the day for me. Also hundreds and hundreds and puffins filled the sky, on their way to and from the ocean and their nests on the cliffs. Overall, we spent about 30 minutes at the black beach. Paid parking (Parka).

We then started our way back and stopped at **Dyrhólaey**. We came to this place for the arched cliff in the ocean, we stayed for the views of the endless black beach and puffins almost within arms' reach. We spent around 1 hour taking it all in. Free parking.

Our last stop of the day was **Sólheimajökulll**, a 15 minute detour from route 1. From the parking lot (you can pay with Parka) it's about a 15 minute walk to the beginning of the glacier. While we had no intention of hiking into the glacier, we had neglected to consider the cold: we thought our warm clothing an raincoats were enough if we just stood in front of the glacier, but after a couple of minutes our body temperature was starting to drop so we made our way back.

Because it had been such a rainy day, we treated ourselves to our first proper Icelandic dinner: cod fillet with baked vegetables in butter. Best cod I've ever had.

**DAY 5**

We had 4 stops planned for the day, and rain accompained us along 3 of them until the middle of the afteroon.

The highlight of the day though was the ever-changing landscape: when we started our drive, it was all green cliffsides, then it became immense expanses of black rocks covered in moss, then at one point it was like we were driving on asphalt road but everywhere around us off the road was also flat and covered in asphalt, then it became endless stretches of tundra.

**Skógafoss**. We hiked all the way to the top of the waterfall. It's an easy 10 minutes hike, with stairs. The main reasons why we included it to our itinerary was that it is a filming location of Game of Thrones, and it's ridiculously close to route 1. We spent about 30 minutes there. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Would I still have visited it if it hadn't been so close to the main road? I'm not sure. Free parking.

**Fjaðrárgljúfur**. Absolutely breathtaking. The hike to the end of the trail is easy and takes about 20 minutes. It's another of those places that pictures don't do it justice. Spent 1 hour exploring every single angle of the canyon from above. Paid parking (Parka).

**Svartifoss**. Very scenic waterfall. We're into hiking, so we loved the 40 minutes hike to reach it. If I could go back, I personally would do it again, but I'm going to be honest: if you're also visiting Stuðlagil Canyon, at the beginning of the trail leading to it is a waterfall with a similar configuration as this one. Spent about 1 hour and a half here (hike included). Paid parking (Parka).

**Diamond Beach & Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon**. You can and should tackle those two together. It's touristy, but for me it's still one of the best places in Iceland. The glacier lagoon more so than the beach. By this time of the day the sky had cleared so we could see the ice glittering in the sunlight. We spent about 2 hours at this place. Paid parking (Parka).

Then we checked in at our Guesthouse in Höfn. Because of the vivid orange sunset we were lucky enough to encounter as we walked around town and its park by the lighthouse, I will never forget about this small town.

**DAY 6**

We began the day at **Stokksnes**. This is a privately owned area famous among photographers: you can get a spectacular view of an endless black beach with a towering mountain the background. To access the area you have to buy a ticket from a bar by the entrance called the Viking Cafe. If you walk by the cliffs you have very good chances of spotting sea lions. It was our first time seeing one and there was a very kind girl next to us who noticed our excitement so she offered to lend us her binoculars to get a better view. If you go to Iceland, bring binoculars! We regret not bringing ours! Also we saw a wild mink. Spent 1.5 hours here.

We then drove on route 1 along the eastern fjords, the views were incredible. Our next stop was Hengifoss so we took a shortcut to an F road to skip a good chunk of route 1. The landscape changed once again... and it was like we were back somewhere in Europe with birch trees and fir trees dotting the land.

**Hengifoss** was spectacular. It's a 40 minute hike from the parking lot, mostly uphill- The good thing is that you can spot the tip of the waterwall from the parking lot and it becomes closer and closer as you make your way up. I was just slightly disappointed to discover that you can't get a little closer to the waterfall. The rock formations leading to the waterwall were also amazing, it looked like gigantic instant coffee chunks. Spent about 1.5 hours here. Paid parking (Parka).

Then we went north of Egilsstaðir to check in at our guesthouse. After dropping our bags, we made two trips before calling it a day:

**Seyðisfjarðarkirkja**. Pretty little village nestled between the mountains. I felt like I was in Norway. We were somewhat hungry, and we decided to eat at a restaurant. While the food was good and the prices in line with what you'd expect in Iceland, I'll admit I felt as though I had fallen for a tourist trap for the first time during our trip. But I only have myself to blame as I had a burger with fries.

**Borgarfjörður eystri**. It took us in total 1.5 hours' driving from Egilsstaðir to Borgarfjörður eystri and then from Borgarfjörður eystri back to our guesthouse. This place is famous as it's the spot for bird-watching in mainland Iceland, especially puffins. Only they had all already migrated. All we saw was the holes they dig as nests. Obviously if I had known, I wouldn't have bothered to drive all the way there. On the way back though, my partner was able to spot an artic fox. By the time I pulled over (there was no one behind me) and turned my head, it had already disappeared amid the bushes.

**DAY 7**

We drove to **Stuðlagil Canyon**. it's about a 20-30 minutes detour from route 1. The road is not paved, but it's an easy drive even without a 4x4 car.

You can access the canyon from the east and the west. On the west parking is free, and you can walk down a flight of stairs to see the canyon from above. Honestly it was underwhelming. If we could go back, we would skip the western side entirely.

Then we went to the east side. We had heard all kind of stories about how hard it is to get to lower parts of the canyon from the parking lot. It was actually an extremely easy, albeit moderately long hike. Took us about 50 minutes each way. It's all straight, no climbs. At the very hand, you can venture down into the canyon by climbing down the basalt columns on its edges. We were lucky enough to witness pristine blue water on that day. It appears the water can also be muddy on some days, making it brown. One of the highlights of our trip for sure. We spent about 3 hours here. Paid parking (Parka).

As we got into our car and started our way north, the weather changed drastically. It started to rain, but the real problem was the wind, so cold and sharp that it felt like blades.

We received an email from our whale-watching tour company in Husavik cancelling our booking due to unstable weather conditions. We had booked a rib boat tour, which we figured is more prone to harsh ocean conditions. We booked an oak boat tour with another company and we made our way to our next stop: Ásbyrgi.

When we got to **Ásbyrgi**, we couldn't find the parking lot, and I admit we had been naive in that we hadn't done a lot of research into how to access this place. But I will also say that as we drove right into the canyon where the forest is, we came across several cars pulled over with people inside them looking as confused as we were. And that's when we received an email from the oak boat tour company, who were also cancelling our booking due to harsh weather forecast. We were tired, dazed by the chilling wind, upset by the tour cancellations, so we just decided to call it quits and made our way to our guesthouse in Husavik early in the afternoon. I'll abstain from saying anything about Ásbyrgi. We've done a fair bit of traveling, it's not the first time we're tempted to push forward when we're not really in the mood for it, and in our experience it was never a good idea. We had dinner early in Husavik at a restaurant (I had the best catfish of my life) and then we had the most restorative sleep of our trip. It was high time we slowed down the pace for half a day.

**DAY 8**

This was the most intense day of our trip. We had so many things planned that we made a drastic decision: we wouldn't visit Dettifoss. We know's it's one of the highlights of Iceland, but after all the waterwalls we had seen, we wanted to spend more time on different things.

We hit the **Diamond Circle**: an area surrounding lake Mývatn where a lot of attractions are close to one another.

**Hverfjall**. This was possibly my favourite place in all of Iceland. It really felt like walking on another planet. It takes about 15 minutes uphill to get to the crater rim, you cannot go down to the center, but you can hike around it. We spent about 2 hours there, but only because we were so engrossed by it. Paid parking (Parka).

**Námafjall**. I don't think it can get any more extraterrestrial than this. A geothermal area where you can see black boiling water, red and yellow soil, natural chimneys. Unlike anything we've ever seen. And it snowed while we were visiting. This is a privately owned place, you have to pay at the parking meter. Spent about 1 hour here, would have spent more if not for the unbearable weather.

**Viti Crater**. By the time we got here, it was just not pleasant to be outside anymore. But because this crater was right in front of the parking lot, we left the comfort of our car, braved the cold, and took a look at the crater. Unfortunately I wish I had spent more time admiring the light blue hues of its lake, but after literally one minute we ran back inside.  Spent 5 minutes here, 4 of which contemplating whether to get out or not. Free parking.

**Namaskardh**. When we got here (very short drive from the crater), it had stopped snowing and it was raining instead. This is a long hike that takes you through the mountains but you can start seeing the geothermal formations well before you start climbing. It was still extremely cold, so after a 30 minute hike as we had already had a glimpse, we turned around and decided to go have lunch. Spent 1 hour here. Free parking.

After a delicious late lunch (we had lamb soup) we went to **Dimmuborgir lava formations**. It was still cold, but it had stopped raining. While this place is not as instantly eye-catching as the others we had seen that day, it was so pleasant to hike among the odd lava shapes we spent more time here than we had anticipated. Spent about 1.5 hours here. Free parking.

**Skútustaðagígar**. This was such a strange place to visit, a lot of bird activity going on. It's a blend of greenery, lake waters and tiny black volcanoes. By this time it was sunny, so we spent about 2 hours walking around this place. Free parking.

We then returned to Husavik as we had 2 nights booked there.

**DAY 9**

After both our whale-watching tours had been cancelled, we tried our luck by booking a last-minute tour in Hauganes. This is the second of two changes of schedules I was talking about earlier on.

The whole day was now centered around the tour, which took place in the early afteroon, so we actually had quite some time to kill.

We visited **Goðafoss**. I'm going to be honest: if it hadn't been such a convenient stop along route 1, and if we hadn't had so much time before the tour, we would have skipped it. I was surprised to see such a huge crowd in the morning at this attraction. The waterfall is beautiful, but we didn't find it as quaint as all the other waterwalls we had seen. Free parking. Spent about 1 hour here.

**Akureyri**. The capital of the North, 4th largest city in Iceland. Again, I'm going to be brutally honest: rainbow walksides, trash bins dressed in gnome costumes, a washing machine out in the open with a sign reading ""Free brainwashing"", it was probably supposed to look characteristic and extravagant to tourists, but the feeling I got strolling around Akureyri was that it was desperate to draw in for a stop all the tourists driving past it along route 1, on their way to or from some much cooler places. There is so much to do and see in Iceland that competition for tourist time and money is fierce, and I got the idea Akureyri is lagging behind in the race.

**Hauganes whale-watching tour**. The reason why we tried our luck and paid in advance for this tour, is that while Husavik is located in a bay, basically exposed to the ocean, Hauganes is nestled in a fjord, so we thought it was partially protected from the bad weather on such a windy day. We still held our breath until the very last minute. Luckily for us, the tour did take place. It lastes 2.5 hours. Quite early in the tour, the captain pointed at a milke whale and then a sperm whale, but I wasn't able to spot either. But we did see several humpbacks. While not my first time seeing whales, I had never seen so close before. The tour was more challenging than I thought it would be though: I didn't get seasick, but I had to pay constant attention to the ocean and the swaying of the waves.

**Hvítserkur**. Quite a detour from route 1 (about 30 minutes farther north) on an F road, this is another highlight for me, simply because we got there quite late in the afternoon, and we were the only two people there, so we got the whole view for ourselves. Spent about 30 minutes here. Free parking.

We spent the night at a guesthouse south of Hvammstangi, right in front of route 1.

**DAY 10**

The only fully sunny day since our second day in Reykjavik. We took the 2.5 hour drive separating us from our first stop of the day.

**Kirkjufell Mountain**. Another popular Game of Thrones filming location. We expected to find a lot more people there. You can hike along a path takes you farther and farther from the mountain (so you can see its shape from different perspectives) and you can hike up to the mountain. We did both, although we didn't climb all the way to the top (I'm not even sure you can do that). Spent about 2 hours here. Paid parking (No parka).

**Stone Bridge**. We drove all the way to Arnarstapi to see its rock formations along the coast. We spent about 1.5 hours hiking along the cliff ridge. But to be honest, if it hadn't been such a nice day, we wouldn't have spent so much time there.

**Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge**. I didn't expect to like this place as much as I did. We hiked all the way to the entrance of the gorge, which takes about 15 minutes, and then as there was a queue to continue the hike on the rocks in the stream we just made our way back. Time spent: 40 minutes. Free parking.

**Búðakirkja**. We only stopped because it was such a short detour, but we weren't particularly impressed. I suppose it becomes very scenic in winter, when the white snow clashes with its black walls. Spent 10 minutes, free parking.

**Ytri Tunga**. This beach is famous for the sea lions living there. We had already seen seals on 3 different occasions by then, but this was the closest we had ever seen them. If you live in a country where seals are a common animal, this spot is absolutely skippable, but for us it was one of the highlights of the day. Spent 1.5 hours there. Paid parking (No parka).

We then drove back north to Stykkishólmur to spend the night.

**DAY 11**

We had done so much the day before we felt like sleeping in on this day. We had planned to visit Fagradalsfjall Volcano before returning to Reykjavik, but by the time we hit the road we realized it would have been possible, but a race against time. Not to mention, it seemed to us the road to the volcano was closed. So we just went back to Reykjavik, checked in at our guesthouse where we dropped our bags, went to return our rental car in the early afternoon... And this is pretty much how the trips ends.

As I mentioned in day 2, we changed our plans. We were supposed to visit Reykjavik in the morning, go to the Sky or Blue Lagoon in the afternoon, and visit Reykjavik more in the afternoon of day 11. When we made that decision, we thought we would go to either Lagoon on day 11 instead, but now it was day 11 and it was very windy and gloomy outside, so we pussied out of it. And because we had already seen everything we wanted to see in Reykjavik, we didn't feel like going outside either. We spent the remainder of day 11 watching movies.

**DAY 12**

Quick trip downtown to buy souvenirs, then we walked to the bus station for the airport transfer at 11:00 am and flew back home.

Happy travels!",49,31.0

We also saw families releasing pufflings on the beach. 

As a fail safe you can always go to the aquarium where they have a few rescue puffins that can't be released. They are behind glass but they are cute and we watched them get fed.",2,
