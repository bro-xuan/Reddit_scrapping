Post,Will visit Iceland in may together with my dad and I would love to have feedback on my iternary. much appreciated!!,zweethond,2025-02-22 15:24:47,"HI all, 

I'm visiting Iceland together with my dad in May of this year. It will be a first for both of us. My dad has been talking about wanting to visit Iceland for a long time but my mom doesn't like the cold. My dad got sick a couple of years ago and is doing better now but the cancer will return someday and since he's also getting older (71) i felt like now is the time to go. So i bought him a flight ticket to Iceland for his birthday last year and told him we're going together. 

We'll have 14 and a half day to spend on this beautiful island. I made a list of things I want to visit and had chatGPT make an iternary. I left the second day open so i have a bit of wiggle room. Do you guys think the iternary is at all doable? I'm not looking to be in a extreme hurry all the time but we do want to make the most of it as for my father he will probably not return to Iceland. 

I would appreciate any feedback! also if i am missing things I must see/do please let me know!. We both don't really care for swimming in hot springs like blue lagoon etc. so that's why i didn't inlcude it. 

  
Thank you so much!!

Post,Is there room for the Westman Islands in this itinerary?,horseyhiker,2025-02-16 22:48:17,"Here is my mid-June high level itinerary.  I'm trying to decide if it's realistic to include the Westman Islands if we don't stay overnight.  I'll be with my 78yo Dad, so we won't be doing long hikes.  It sounds like we can see Puffins in Vik, so I don't want to go to Westman just to see them.  I really want to see Diamond Beach.

Day 1: arrive in KEF at 10pm

Day 2: start at Rey; drive Golden Circle; overnight in Selfoss

Day 3: drive to Vik; overnight in Vik

Day 4: drive to Hofn and back to Vik; overnight in Vik

Comment,,jessica_wanders,2025-02-16 23:18:25,Day 2 or 5. Yes you can see puffins in Dyrhólaey but you can get closer to them on Heimaey. There’s also a beautiful small stave church. The beluga whale sanctuary is right in town and has a puffin rescue. Great view as you approach the islands. Worth a day trip if you have time.,3,
Post,Where to stay outside of Reykjavík with three year old in April?,La_Juche_Vita,2025-02-12 16:45:26,"TL;DR: Where should spouse, young kid and I stay outside of Reykjavik in late April? 

My spouse, kid (3yo) and I are going to Iceland at the end of April. We’ll be there for 7 days and plan on spending about half in Reykjavik and half somewhere else, and renting a car for the duration. My main two questions are: 

A) What will we need in a vehicle? (Size, 4WD, AWD, 2WD, etc.). Driving in icy/snowy conditions with a compact 2WD and snow tires is common where we’re from, but we don’t want to assume the conditions will be similar.

B) Where should we stay for our outside of Reykjavik portion, given the time of year and our interests? General area, specific town, or accommodations recommendations all appreciated.

Our interests (in approximate order of priority), and sub-questions:

1. **Puffins:** The kid loves puffins and it would mean a lot to see some in real life. I noticed most of the boat tours don’t start until the first week of May, and don’t let kids under 5 or so on board anyways. Are there any places you can (likely) see them from land at the end of April, or family friendly boat tours? Would be interested in other kinds of birdwatching as well.

2. **Unique geology/nature:** We all love hiking, and have a good rig for carrying the kid if necessary, but don’t want to be going anywhere too treacherous or that requires an all-day trek. We prefer DIYing it, but will splurge for a guided tour if necessary. What are accessible must-sees? Which part of the island is worth focusing on?

3. **Saltwater fishing:** Would be willing to hire a charter, but similar to puffin tours I’m mostly seeing this starting up in May—any charters that would operate at the end of April or is it dangerous? Failing that, any towns with piers/shorelines where people fish from land? Shore-targetable species and tackle shop recommendations also welcome! 

4. **Hot springs:** Self explanatory, kid friendly would be ideal if it exists! 

5. **Anything traditional or unique:** We like learning about the history and culture of a place. Farms, museums, traditional or unique foods, historical sites, local products etc.

Really enjoying reading through all the old threads on here and the helpful advice—will continue to search through them but I figured because of my particular circumstances I’d write something up here. In addition to my specific questions, I appreciate any and all bits of relevant advice or recommendations! ",0,3.0
Post,Review my itinerary,PostPunkBurrito,2025-02-12 15:05:05,"We are going in August (I know it is the busiest time but it is all my schedule allows). This is the bare bones outline of the trip so far for me, wife and 10 year old.

We had to make some concessions -- rushing the east so we can fit in a day in Thorsmark (which we are super excited about). A very long drive between Akureyri and Grundarfjörður). 

Questions: where can we see Puffins along this itinerary? Is there a natural place here to fit in a relatively easy glacier hike? Anything problematic, something I am not considering or life changing that I am missing (ha)?

Any comments or thoughts are so appreciated-- this community has been essential to my trip planning, thanks so much.

Comment,,tgbarbie,2025-02-12 15:47:52,"We did a similar trip in late August with my 10 and 13 yos.  We did see puffins in Vik, at Reynisfjara. I would definitely plan some time to stop there, maybe afternoon Day 4.  We did a glacier hike through the company Local Guides that you would need to do on the morning of Day 5.  We are a pretty in shape family but it wasn't too much for my 10 year old. They provided the crampons and gear, was a fantastic experience.  Day 6 is a really long day. Try to make the stop at Petra's Stone Collection, we loved it.   May I suggest that instead of driving all the way to Myvatn that day, stop in Egilstadir for the night? The Vok baths there were our favorite hot pool experience, and you can complete the drive on Day 7.  I would stay 2 nights in Myvatn and maybe only 1 in Akureyri. It's a really small city. Day 9 you'll probably explore the north of the Snaefelesness Peninsula, then Day 10, round the bend and explore the south. You can stop in Borgarnes on your drive back to Reykjavik, not sure what you mean by West Coast. 

All of this is just my two cents :)  And also, definitely download the map of Icelandic jumping pillows.  We stopped at so many and it was a great way to take a break from the car and explore small towns, and meet local kids.",2,
Post,11 days in Iceland - help finalizing timing?,Meetthewaldayan,2025-02-11 16:50:09,"Hi All! I will be in Iceland for 11 days in mid-late April. 

I have done a bunch of research and have an itinerary I am generally happy with, except a few issues: 

1. I am wondering if it would be better to spend 2 nights in Snaefelles as my list of sights is long in that area. i could split the sights into two days, with a slightly longer drive day straight to Akureyi on April 17. Is the night in Skagafjordur worth keeping?

2. I'm not sure if two nights in Akureyi makes sense or if I should do one there and one in Myvatn. There are so many sights around Myvatn that it would be a bit frustrating to drive back to Akureyi that day and then back east again to continue the ring road  the next day. However, I've heard that Myvatn itself is not really worth staying in, and I like the idea of being in a place for two nights.

3. April 19/20 are a bit light on activities - maybe that's OK, I don't mind some slower days but maybe there is something worth doing that I'm missing. or combine these days into one long driving day and cut the hotel in Seydisfjordur**?**

4. Should i leave a whole day for the Westman Islands? I could probably add one more day onto this itinerary, though it would hurt a bit because... budget

Some of our ideas have been snorkeling, going to lesser known thermal lagoons, lava tube tour, diamond beach and possibly a boat trip to see puffins. I’ve been doing lots of research on places to go and our ultimate debate is a sleeper van vs renting a car and staying at hotels. Any pros and cons on both? Any fun tips or ideas on things to do?

It offers discounts for a few things I was planning on doing (Perlan, Elding Whale/Puffin watching). I was planning on pre-purchasing admission for these as I know June is busy tourist season. Does anyone know if it is possible to buy a ticket online using the City Card discount (especially if the card isn’t activated yet but will be on the day of the use)? Everything I see just says that you show the card when purchasing the ticket to get the discount, but Perlan and Elding both recommend booking online ahead of time. I don’t want to pay full price if I’m buying the City Card but I also don’t want to wait to buy a ticket and find out the tour time I want is sold out…",1,2.0
Post,Cruise stops and 2 additional days in Iceland mid-late August,littleadventures,2025-02-09 04:25:23,"I’m going on a cruise in mid-late August with stops in Iceland, including two ports of call: Akureyri (9 AM to 9 PM) and Ísafjörður (9 AM to 6 PM). After the cruise, we’ll stay for two additional full days in Iceland.

I’ve been to Iceland once before and visited the Ring Road (including Akureyri), Golden Circle, and Snæfellsnes Peninsula, but it will be my mom’s first visit. I’d like to balance my familiarity with Iceland and her first-time experience.

My mom is a senior who used to hike a lot but recently has some knee pain. She can comfortably walk for 35-45 minutes and seems to be improving daily, but longer or strenuous hikes might not work. We may have to see when we get there. For good viewpoints or activities that don’t require much walking, I’d love recommendations.

For the two ports of call (Akureyri and Ísafjörður):

Are there must-see highlights near these locations? I’ve been to Akureyri before and open to ideas but prefer to be outside if the weather allows and less interested in museums.

Would horse riding or puffin viewing be recommended in these areas?

Should we spend time exploring the towns or focus on nearby nature instead?

For the two days after the cruise, I’m thinking the south coast. does this itinerary sound reasonable?

[Edit: apologies for the formatting. I’m on mobile]

Day 1: 
Drive from Reykjavík,
Seljalandsfoss (I’ve been before),
Gljúfrabúi,
Skógafoss (I’ve been before),
Svartifoss (Should we skip? I think it’s a 60-90 minute walk/hike?),
Dyrhólaey (puffins),
Reynisfjara (I’ve been before),
Stay overnight in Vik

Day 2:
Vík i Myrdal Church (Víkurkirkja),
Svínafellsjökull Viewpoint,
Fjallsárlón,
Jökulsárlón zodiac tour (I’ve been before),
Diamond Beach (I’ve been before),
Höfn (Probably skip since is another hour further from Jökulsárlón and would be the furthest east we go. I’ve had amazing langoustine at Pakkhús Restaurant but don’t know if we’ll have time),
Drive back to Reykjavík via Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon (60 min walk/hike),
End the day with a hot spring (not necessarily Blue Lagoon—thinking Sky Lagoon or Secret Lagoon)

Does this itinerary sound manageable? Would you suggest skipping or adding anything to make it better? Should I consider another region entirely instead of south coast? I thought south coast was my favorite area last time. ",1,2.0

Comment,,PolarBearEnt,2025-02-08 06:48:47,"Puffin season is generally from early May to end of August. You could do a Whale Watching tour from Reykjavik with a RIB boat, they'll most likely pass by the puffin island, and if the puffins have arrived early then you may see them. I'd recommend the tour with Elding.is, called premium whale watching from Reykjavik. 

A guaranteed way to see puffins would be to do a day trip to the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar), and go to the beluga whale and puffin sanctuary.

Comment,,Just-Replacement8284,2025-02-08 01:53:31,"It's not likely at all that there will be either tours or puffins at that time.  Tour operate by giving the customers what they are paying for and the little critters are still thinking about their trip to Iceland at this time of year... 

Best time is June-August...",1,
Comment,,goodie1663,2025-02-08 16:46:52,"My guess is that most of the operators do those dates because they can pretty much count on having puffins then, and it's not worth offering dates where they have to cancel. 

I was there the third week in August, and the tour operator had to cancel all tours on the day I booked because of bad weather. When they called me, they suggested doing the first tour of the day the next day because generally the weather was better then, so that's what I did. 

I very much enjoyed it, but we only saw maybe twenty total or so. The guide said that they were going to cancel all tours after that day and give refunds because the puffins had clearly decided that it was time to leave. 

I did see more of them later in several other locations, but you truly never know. Weather is also a factor.",1,
Comment,,LtheDutch,2025-02-08 02:27:48,"I appreciate this. It had seemed from my research that they tended to come back mid-April, but I didn't know if it was even worth trying to find someone to take us.  Thank you.",2,

I feel like I have planned a waterfall trip. I have waterfalls everywhere, which is fine because waterfalls are awesome. Do you recommend looking into anything more cultural? Volcano? Glacier? Kayaking?

Also, part of me really loves the idea of Hornstridir, is that worth the price and time commitment and removing everything east of Reykjavik? I feel like If I did that, I would do everything north and west instead of south and east. Would love any thoughts on that. Maybe I am just in love with one image of the cliffs and the foxes.

Comment,,PolarBearEnt,2025-02-07 07:25:08,"A few additions I'd recommend!

On arrival day, you can book the evening Lava Show in Vík, great introduction to Iceland's geology and volcanic history, education and entertaining experience. 

In the Jökulsárlón area, you could do the zodiac tour on Fjallsárlón (better than the one on Jökulsárlón), or a glacier hike, to get an upclose experience with the glaciers.

In the Westman islands, the RIB safari is a great way to see the coastline and puffins, as well as learn some history about the islands.

In the Golden Circle, having lunch at Friđheimar is a must-do! You could also try the Hrunalaug hot spring, very cheap hot spring experience, the land owners prevent too many people from entering at once so it is not overly crowded. 

Final day in Reykjavik, maybe do the free walking tour, will give you a chance to ask a local some questions about Iceland which you may have thought of during your visit, also its a nice introduction to the city.",2,

Part of me still wants to head west instead of south but I also want to make sure I am being smart about this and not over complicating the travel. I dont want to treat this like a checklist either, yet I want to see so much. Beaches, waterfalls, hikes is our main interest. So, any help with this itinerary or questions specific to late July would be appreciated so much! 

**Here are my main questions along with this.** 

What would you suggest as a highlight full day hike worth planning around? Right now I have Fimmvorduhals. Or even an over nighter?

What would you suggest for a kayak tour? Right now I have the Lagoon by Diamond beach. 

Any suggestions for Puffins? 

Am I totally missing something amazing to consider? 

Obviously I want to avoid crowds, but we live Between Zion and Yellowstone and so I know theres worse crowds than what Iceland gets in the summer!

Comment,,moomeecee,2025-02-06 21:16:20,"I am admittedly \*not\* a hiker, but I think a day trip to Heimaey (Westman Islands) would give you good hiking, great views, and puffins galore!  Maybe as an alternative for your July 29?",6,
Comment,,outsideleyla,2025-02-06 20:43:23,"Your itinerary looks pretty good, but here are some important points: 

\-The Fimms trail is no joke. Most people take the bus to Thorsmork, then hike their way back toward Skogafoss. I would suggest doing it that way so you're always making your way back toward Vik, rather than possibly getting stuck. You MUST have a good weather day to do this hike. With only 6 days, you'd have to make smart decisions on whether to turn back/complete the hike. Make sure to have plenty of emergency food/water/etc. 

\-July 30 - you want to spend the night in the Skaftafell area. Either Hotel Skaftafell, Fosshotel, or a guest house. 

\-July 31 - there are lots of great hikes in the Skaftafell area. Go to visitor center and get their map of hiking trails. If you want to do Fimms I think you'd enjoy Skaftafell/Vatnajokull area a lot. 

\-Careful on your last day; if your flight departs at 7:55 PM, note that you want to be there at least 2 hours in advance because it can be a cluster getting everyone on the planes. For some reasons, departures are very chaotic at Keflavík.

Puffins can be found at Vik on the cliffs on the peninsula!",1,
Comment,,moomeecee,2025-02-07 14:08:11,"We actually spent the night there and enjoyed it - took the ferry over around noon, then grabbed lunch at Ranya Kebab.

Went on the ""Puffins and Volcanos"" tour with [https://www.eyjatours.com/](https://www.eyjatours.com/) \- we really enjoyed this as a way to learn about the history and culture of the island with lots of beautiful stops/views.

Post,Opinion - April,SunnyD405OKC,2025-02-06 05:37:42,"Iceland Itinerary Overview
	•	Day 1: Arrive → Blue Lagoon → Dinner at Dill → Stay at The Reykjavík EDITION
	•	Day 2: Golden Circle → Stay at ION Adventure Hotel
	•	Day 3: South Coast Exploration → Stay at Hotel Rangá
	•	Day 4: Snowmobiling + Chef’s Dinner → Stay at Hotel Rangá
	•	Day 5–6: Option A: Drive to Hotel Búðir (Snæfellsnes Peninsula)
OR
Option B: Return to Reykjavík for 2 nights of relaxation and city exploration

My Thoughts:

I originally planned to visit the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, but I’m questioning if it’s worth the long drive in April without the lush green landscapes that make it shine in late spring and summer. I’m sure it’s still stunning, but maybe less dramatic compared to peak seasons—and it’s quite a drive!

At the same time, Reykjavík doesn’t seem to get much hype for extended stays beyond a day or two, so I’m torn. Do I venture out for rugged coastal scenery or enjoy 48 hours of relaxed city vibes to end the trip?

I suppose we could always do the peninsula as a day trip from Reykjavik if we have the steam left at the end of the trip. We aren’t much for sitting around but I’m also concerned that a waterfall is a waterfall is a waterfall.  Adding some variety is probably helpful to not get overly accustomed to the beauty.

Also, I’d be willing to travel/stay for puffins!  I understand there a chance of seeing them in the Westman Islands pre-Easter? (Argument for more time near Hotel Ranga.)

Help me decide…. Day 5-6… we are self driving but I’m not against hiring a guide for a day. ",1,4.0

It’s our first time visiting and I would really love some opinions. Maybe we’re doing too much on one day, maybe we’re not doing enough on another.

We will be traveling in Iceland in mid-April and might want to try to reach Látrabjarg to try our luck and catch a glimpse of some early nesting puffin, but I cannot find any info of the state of the this road during April.

The car company we use to rent our Campervan say we cannot drive on a grey road on [road.is](http://road.is), so will the road 612 be graded in mid-April ? 

What are the odds of seeing a puffing mid-April ? Is there anywhere around the Island where it would be easier to try to find them ?

Post,Our Iceland Ring Road and Westfjords Trip of 3 weeks (MAY/JUNE),Natural-Amazement,2025-01-25 09:20:06,"Our Iceland Ring Road and Westfjords trip we did in 3 weeks time is finally here and hopefully you will get inspired to visit this wonderful country at least once in your lifetime. It is already well over a year ago, but because of questions I still get about other posts I made here, I decided to make 1 big post and movie that has got it all.

You can watch my full 80 minute video here: [https://youtu.be/HRAzX8Fb2vM](https://youtu.be/HRAzX8Fb2vM)

With almost 100 places we visited in 3 weeks, this video will give you a good idea of how we experienced our time in Iceland. You will see epic waterfalls, gorgeous canyons, scenic landscapes, hazardous roads and of course some Icy experiences...

We went in May and June to increase our chances to see as much of Iceland as possible without being in the absolute peak season of tourists.

The weather was very Icelandic, which means we regularly had 4 seasons in 1 day: blue skies, hailstorms, severe winds, brights sunshine and heavy rains is what you can expect here, which creates a landscape that often feels out of this world and is nothing like I ever experienced before.

Although the whole country was one big highlight for me, some of my personal favorites where: Katla Ice Cave, Jökulsárlon Glacier Lagoon, Stuðlagil Canyon, Stapavík and the Svalvogar Circle (guided tour) in the Westfjords.

At every place we stopped, I felt like we could spend an extra day (or more) hiking and just enjoying the moment. We went 3 weeks and our itinerary was planned to not be rushed and to really have the time to let each moment sink in. We were with 4 people in one car.

In the video, you will see which day we are at in the bottom right of the screen. At the top left, you will regularly see the distance and time traveled between 2 places when we where on the road. If you need more specific information on time/distance between places, please let me know!

While it is already well over a year ago, it still feels like yesterday and gets me craving to go back every time I watch this video. And we will go back, that's for sure!

You will find the itinerary below here. For specific Timestamps of the video, please see the video description on youtube to skip to the part of your interest.

If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment, (either here or on youtube, I will check both comment sections to see if I can give some tips where I can).

Post,Suggestions/tips about visit in August,Bright-Psychology808,2025-01-17 21:40:25,"Hello everybody,

it's my turn to ask help for itinerary :)

I am planning my 3rd visit to Iceland for this summer. During my 1st time (summer) 2 years ago I visited Golden Circle, Reykjanes peninsula, south coast, Snaefelness and Thorsmork. On my 2nd time I did Golden circle and south coast only as it was during winter.

For my 3rd visit I finally want to drive the whole ring road. I can allocate 10 full days (not counting the day I fly in and I fly out) which most likely will be August 9-18. I'll focus more on the East and the North as I haven't seen them before, however I still want to include a couple days again in the south (as I like photography and as this will be my 1st time in Iceland alone, I can take my time to find good shots that I want) and Snaefellness (I loved that area during my 1st visit, I want to spend some time there again), adding a few new spots that I haven't visited before in those areas as well. However I'll skip the GC.

Another item on my agenda is - hopefully - to see puffins.

I'll be camping so locations of my overnight stays will be very flexible, as I won't need to book anything in advance.

I came up with a first raw itinerary, but still struggling with some choices therefore asking some help. This is what I was thinking:

**DAY 0: Arrival, car pick up**

**DAY 1: Reykjavik – Vik or Kirkjubaejarklaustur**

Possible stops: Seljalandfoss, Skogafoss, Dyrholaey, Reynisfjara, Eldhraun lava fields

**DAY 2: Kirkjubaejarklaustur - Hofn**

Possible stops: Fjadrargljulfur, Svinafellsjokull, Skaftafell/Svartifoss, Hofskirkja, Jokusarlon. Sleep near Hofn

**DAY 3: Hofn - Seydisfjordur**

Possible stops: Stokness & Vestrahorn, Eystrahorn, Djupivogur, Egilsstadir, Seydisfjordur (sleep here)

**DAY 4: Around Egilsstadir**

Possible stops: Hengifoss & Litlanesfoss, Borgafjordur Estri for puffins, sleep around Egilsstadir

**DAY 5 Egilsstadir - Myvatn**

Possible stops: Studlagil canyon, Dettifoss, (Hljodaklettar - I would be curious to check this one but looks a bit far. Probably not doable), Asbyrgi, sleep near Myvatn

**DAY 6 – Around Myvatn**

Possible stops: Hverarond, Krafla, Leirhnjukur, Grjotagja, Hverfjall, Dimmuborgir, Myvatn – sleep near Myvatn (or on the way to Godafoss)

**DAY 7: Myvatn – Hofsos**

Possible stops: Godafoss, Akureyri, Siglufjordur, Hofsos, sleep nearby

**DAY 8:  Hofsos** **– Hvammstangi**

Possible stops: Glaumbaer turf houses, Kalfhamarsvik, Hvitserkur, sleep near Hvammstangi

**DAY 9: Hvammstangi – Snaefellsness**

Possible stops: Berserkjahraun, Kirkjufell, Svodufoss, Ingjaldsholskirkja, Skardsvik, sleep somewhere on the peninsula.

**DAY 10 Snaefellsness – Reykjavik**

Possible stops: Djupalonssandur, Malarrif, Arnastapi & Hellnar, Budir and Budahraun, Ytri Tunga, drive to Reykjavik

**DAY 11 Bye bye Iceland** (see you again)

  
Now, the itinerary as it is it involves a reasonable amount of driving to me (during my 1^(st) visit in summer I quite enjoyed driving there, even for 250/300 km), however I have some doubts especially on the 2nd part:

\- Day 7/8 - Is the detour to Trollaskagi peninsula worth it? Siglufjordur looks very nice to me but I wonder if I should use this all amount of driving somewhere else.

\- Day 8/9 - Partially related, but the whole drive from Trollaskagi to Snaefellness looks like without much to see. Would you arrange this part somehow differently? Anything else you recommend to see/skip?

\- Puffins: I read that mid-august may be already a bit late but I hope I can still see them. Apart from Dyrholaey where I'll go anyway, I have basically allocated entire day 4 for Borgafjordur Estri which I read is one of the best spots to see puffins. Is this long detour worth it, considering also the time of the year? Or I should better try to add a day at Westman islands instead? (however I read Borgafjordur Estri is better for watching puffins closer - which may be better for photography.)

\- In general the main other places that I was considering for possible detours were Westman islands or even Kerlingarfjoll (renting 4wd of course), however I may need to allocate at least 1.5 days for either of the two, so I would need to cut somewhere else - not totally sure at the moment. 

\- I'll probably save other places like the Westfjords and Landmannalaugar for my 4th future visit :)

Would love to hear any suggestion or tips! Obviously my itinerary will remain flexible till the end, but I like to start dreaming about the trip from now :D  

Thanks a lot!

Comment,,highlanderfil,2025-01-17 21:55:03,"Your first day looks pretty packed. I'm not saying you can't do it (especially if you can sleep on planes), but you'll be exhausted at the end of it. We did a similar drive with barely any stops last August (our first hotel was in Kirkjubaejarklaustur) and I had to pull off at the top of the hill above Hveragerdi to take a cat nap so that I didn't drive off the road. Otherwise, it looks like a reasonable itinerary.

Re puffins: we've been two Augusts in a row and there were puffins on Dyrholaey both years. However, someone had pointed out to me that in 2022 puffins were gone from there by the third week of August.",1,

Post,My trip during monsoon season!,Beautiful-Lettuce425,2025-01-17 17:18:32,"(I’m kidding…. Kind of 🤣)

This trip was absolutely life changing and I’m here to tell you that whatever you have to sacrifice to make it to Iceland is 10000% worth it. I started planning a second trip before I even left.

Details below!

The weather was absolutely HEINOUS (rained heavily every single day, had almost 100% cloud coverage, 60+ mph winds) and although it was unfortunate for obvious reasons, being the ONLY people at some of the most popular sights in Iceland was something I’ll never be able to experience again. The wind was so strong at kirkjufell I was sliding across the ice putting my spikes on and I would 100% do it again to be the only person there. We also got to essentially watch the seasons change, and see all the melted ice turn blue. 

Itinerary
Day 1
Dogsledding at Iceland HQ (expensive but unforgettable, heavy snow and low visibility and it just looked absolutely surreal)
Phallogical Museum

Day 2
Kirkjufell (hiked, only people there)
Arnarstapi (walked around the cliffs)
Snaefellus Penninsula/ Hellissandur (drove, favorite view of the trip)
Budak (church/trails and glacier viewpoint, only people there)

Day 3
Reynisfjara (first people there)
(Ice cave tour was cancelled)
Fjaðrárgljúfur (hiked, only people there)

Day 4
Gullfoss
Geysir 
Thingvellir (oxarafoss was my favorite view of the trip)
Explored downtown Reykjavík 

Day 5
Langihryggur (tried to hike, weather kicked my ass, ate shit in the mud, ended up with a swamp inside my boots 🤣 ended up leaving and driving around Grindavik area/mossy lava rocks)
Antiksalan & Antikbudan
Sky Lagoon

Day 6
Kerid Crater
Seljalandsfoss Waterfall
Katla Ice Cave Tour (100000% worth the money)

Day 7
Blue Lagoon

Bars
Lemmy 
Prikid 

Restaurants 
Freidheimer
Deig 
Himalayan Spice
Ramen Momo
Black Crust Pizzeria

Things I would do differently
I wouldn’t stay in Reykjavík the whole time. It was super convenient to have a home base but I think I could’ve done more if I stayed northwest the first half and toward Vik the second half. It also made it difficult to see the aurora, since we would’ve had to get in the car and drive out the city if it decided to show up late in the night. That being said, driving around for 4-6 hours a day really let us see A LOT of the land and some of my favorite sights I just happened to drive by. 

I wanted to try the food since it was my first time there, but as a vegan it was extremely disappointing (I know I know, I expected it to be.) There was an option almost everywhere we went which is awesome but most of it was just not good. I would for sure just hit the grocery store for sandwiches and what not next time.

Price Breakdown for Two (approx)
$750 flights/baggage (PLAY SWF-KEF)
$884 hotel for 7 nights (paid an extra day so we could check in at 6am, Marina Reykjavík)
$324 rental car (free insurance with CC, ACE)
$400 gas 
$750 food snacks groceries
$450 drinks
$1200 guided tours(dog sledding, Katla tour)/lagoons
$300 souvenirs
$100 parking

After my CC points (~$1200) it was about $4000 EVERYTHING included for two of us for seven days. After doing the ‘once in a lifetime’ things and learning the food situation it could be done for at least $1500 less.




Things to do next time!

Horse riding

Post,Help with August 2025 itinerary. ,Iliketrees7777,2025-01-14 08:44:15,"Hi all, 

I've never been to Iceland before. I am planning a two-week trip from roughly August 15-30 (give or take a day or two). Could you give me some feedback on the itinerary (primarily after day 8)? The two most important things to me are seeing the highlands (i.e., the trek) and seeing puffins on the Westman Islands.  Based on other feedback I’ve read here, I don’t think I would enjoy trying to do the entire Ring Road in between days 8-14 and so I’d rather focus on a smaller part of the county in more depth. But there are some days where I'm worried I'm taking it TOO slow (specific questions below). 

Day 1 – Fly into to Reykjavik in the morning, explore the city, maybe Sky Lagoon.

Days 2-7 – Laugavegur & Fimmvörðuháls Trek through Artic Adventures, back in Reykjavik in the evening of Day 7, stay in Reykjavik.  

Day 8 – Sleep somewhat late (due to six prior days of hiking and sleeping in huts), pick up rental car, drive to Landeyjahöfn, take afternoon/evening ferry to Westman islands. Sleep on Heimaey. **\[Is it worth trying to squeeze in some part of the Golden Circle on this day or is that too much?\]**

Day 9 – Puffin tour, either stay in Heimaey again or take the evening ferry out and stay in Vik. **\[Is two nights in Heimaey worth it for maximum puffin opportunity or is Vik preferable?\]** 

Day 10 –Skaftafell/Svartifoss, black sand beach, etc., stay near near Jökulsárlón.

Day 11 – Diamond Beach, glacier kayaking tour. Stay near Jökulsárlón again **\[Is this too much time in the Jökulsárlón area?\]**

Day 12 – Glacier hike or do some longer hikes in between Jökulsárlón and Höfn, Stay in Höfn.

Day 13  – Drive to Stokknes then drive back to Reykjavik (6 hours), stopping to see anything I missed on previous days. Stay in Reykjavik. 

Day 14 – Chill at Hvammsvik Hot Springs and lazily see some sights on the way there and back. Stay in Reykjavik or maybe in an airport hotel. \[**Is there a better way to use this day?**\]

Day 15 – fly out in the morning

3 days near Skaftafell for the National park
3 days in Seyðisfjörður for the fjords and puffins
1 day in Höfn as rest stop back southwest
3 days in Laugarvatn for the golden circle

Post,Trip Report – August 2023 Snaefellsnes,m3lonmama,2025-01-13 02:14:47,"We (two older adults and our twenty-something children) went to Iceland mid-August 2023.  We had six full days (including an early arrival on day 1) and about half a day on our last day in Iceland.  We toured the Snaefellsnes peninsula, Thingvellir, and the south coast as far as Jokulsarlon, with the last half day spent in Reykjavik.  Accommodations included guest houses, Airbnb’s and hotels. Excursions included horseback riding, Thorsmark SuperJeep Day Tour with Midguard (trip highlight), Glacier Adventure with Melrakki, and Fjallsarlon lagoon rib boat tour (the “kids” did the glacier adventure while my husband and I did the rib boat tour).  For our spa lagoon experience we went to Krauma.  We loved and would recommend everything we did.                

 Since so much is written about the south coast I thought I’d highlight Snaefellsnes.  The day and a half we had in this area we had the worst weather of our trip - alternating drizzle, rain, and high winds.  We wore our waterproof gear and just kept going, as did others we met along the way.

 \-        Kirkjufellfoss (photo 1) – When we arrived at the parking lot for Kirkjufellsfoss, the wind was raging.  To get to the spot to take the iconic picture of the waterfall and the mountain, you have to go across a bridge and then walk across the spine of a hill.  We could barely stand up to walk across the bridge; no way we were going out on that narrow path!  I’m happy with my photo although it’s not the one I had planned on.   I still smile when I think about laughing with all the other tourists at how idiotic it was that we’d even gotten out of our cars.  Unpopular opinion – a lot of people go quite a distance out of their way to get this photo.  If you are limited in time, I would only prioritize this if it was along my route. 

\-        Djupalonssandur (photos 2,3,4) – we chose to go to this beach instead of Reynisfjara so that we could have the black sand beach experience without the crowds.  There is a short hike to get to the beach, then there’s the wreckage of a trawler, the stones you can use to prove your strength, and finally the beach itself, which is beautiful to explore.  I can’t say how it compares to Reynisfjara since we didn’t stop there but we really enjoyed this area.  In general, if you’re worried about crowds, I would look for alternatives to some of the “top ten” spots.  Dramatic beauty abounds.

\-        Londranger (5) – this is a quick stop with a view point which resulted in one of the best photos I took in Iceland.  If we’d had more time, there was a path that looked interesting which would have made this a more rewarding stop but it was worth it for the photo. 

\-        Arnarstapi (6,7) – there were no seals at Ytri Tunga when we stopped there but we did see a couple at Arnarstapi.  This was a beautiful area and we enjoyed walking the path partway to Hellnar – we had hoped to go the whole way but we did not really have time and the rainy day was not ideal for this.  A lot of birds make their homes in the cliffs here (although it’s not the place for puffins).   

\-        Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge(8,9) – We had planned to skip this but stopped on spur of the moment and it was one of our favorite things that we did.  We didn’t go very far inside as it was slippery with all the rain but just walking up to that looming cliff, getting closer and closer, then creeping inside – we were in awe.  My photos don't do justice to this amazing site.

\-        Budarkirkje (black church)(10) – It’s black.  And it’s a church.  I don’t get it but there is a path I would have loved to have had time to follow.  I believe I read that it leads to another beautiful black sand beach. 

\-        We also made quick stops at Gerduberg Cliffs and Sheep’s Waterfall aka Selvallafoss (apparently you can walk behind this waterfall but it was too slippery when we were there), and drove through Berserkjahraun lava field.  We unfortunately didn’t have time to see Svardsvik (golden sand) beach or Svortuloft Lighthouse, or to climb Saxholl Crater, or to see any of the myriad other things that don’t make anyone’s blog.  

\-        We had our best meal of the trip at Bjargarsteinn Mathus in Grundarfjordur.  This restaurant is absolutely charming, the food is amazing and very local, and you have a view of Kirkjufell.  In high season, reservations are a must as the restaurant is tiny and we saw several people turned away.

\-        Last two photos are of Krauma.

 By now you see why they call Snaelsfellsness, “Iceland in Miniature”.  You probably also saw a recurring theme… we didn’t have enough time.  I know people do the ring road in five days but for me, some of the side paths we DID make time for were my favorite parts of the trip as there was such a sense of exploration and discovery.   If I had it to do over again, I’d either add a day or two to the trip or cover less territory.  Also, many sights, like Kirkjufellsfoss, require a short hike and careful footwork as you get closer, which feels a bit precarious if it’s windy.  Just keep that in mind when you are thinking about the impact of weather on your trip.

Thanks for reading.  I’m happy to answer any questions.

If you’ve read this far, thank you! We were told that with 16 days, we should head to the Westfjords. But what I’ve researched is that you need 3-4 days for the Westfjords and that would really condense our Ring Road itinerary. We’re also travelling with elementary school aged kids so we don’t want to go at a pace where they’ve checked out on day 5 from exhaustion.  

Anything I’ve missed, you would add or remove from the itinerary? ",1,8.0
Comment,,soulima17,2025-01-10 19:38:49,"Looks well thought out. 

Perhaps more time in Reykjavik?

Borgarfjordur Eystri was ok, but it's a good half day detour, especially if you are seeing puffins earlier.",2,
Comment,,Ikura87,2025-01-11 23:45:40,"This is a good outline.  It's super jamb-packed, and don't feel bad about slowing down a bit at the places you are most excited about and maybe skipping some others as a day of decision.  If the puffins are still around, you should see them in the Westman Islands and Dyhrolaey.   There is a captive one that lives in the Whale Sanctuary, so that was our puffin experience in late September. 

We loved the Westman Islands, and if you can stay the night there and catch an early boat back, you'll save some backtracking.   Gott was good for dinner.

The Troll Peninsula drive is great and highly recommended.  

Enjoy!",1,
Comment,,xjsir,2025-01-10 19:46:55,Do you recommend that I skip Borgarfjordur Eystri? It is a detour and we’ll be there mid August so I’m wondering if the Puffins will be gone by then. I heard the drive there is beautiful though.,1,
Comment,,soulima17,2025-01-10 20:06:37,"Puffins leave at the end of August.

Post,Any advice on my 8 day ring road trip? ,FieryTaco123,2025-01-07 07:15:48,"We have 9 days and 8 nights for our upcoming trip end of May. We’re not big hikers and are more about driving to enjoy scenery and stopping for nice photo ops. We are both two young adults, active. 

Our rough itinerary is (and I know this is busy, it’s sort of how we travel):

Day 1 - Reykjavik and Blue Lagoon

Day 2 - Thingvillir

Day 3 - Vik, Black Sand Beach, Skogafoss, Kvernufoss, Katla Ice Cave, Skalakot Manor

Day 4 - Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon, Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon tour, Diamond Beach, Pakkhus

Day 5 - Drive to Seydisfjordur (stay overnight) and then see puffins at Borgarfjarðarhöfn, maybe fit in Vok Baths

Day 6 - Drive to Stuðlagil Canyon, Dettifoss, Lake Myvatn, Vogafjós Farm for lunch, then go to Akureyi and stay for night, maybe do Forest Lagoon at night

Day 7 - Explore Akureyi then drive to Snæfellsnes Peninsula, check into Hotel Budir in late afternoon

Day 8 - Relax around Hotel Budir, then drive to Reykjavik for dinner, maybe OX or Dill, Sky lagoon? before early flight out 

Day 9 - 10 AM flight 


Should we keep Snæfellsnes with this itinerary? I’ve heard good things re Hotel Budir. Also I know we’re not big hikers but I’m not 100% sure how much time to allocate for Stuðlagil Canyon or Lake Myvatn sight s. 

We only really have to be back in Reykjavik for dinner before our 10 AM flight - are there better areas to visit that are relaxing other than Snaefellsnes? It doesn’t seem like there’s much on the drive between Akureyi and Reykjavik. ",1,2.0

Comment,,Guide-to-Iceland,2025-01-07 04:38:32,"Reykjavík has some great cultural experiences, so if your flight schedule allows, spending your last day in Reykjavík could provide a nice urban balance to your trip, but you likely won't regret prioritising Iceland's natural wonders over the city! Reykjavík does have some must-see attractions, including the iconic Hallgrímskirkja Church, several fascinating museums, and a delicious food scene.

Sunday - Snaefellsnes National Park and nearby waterfalls. Drive back to Reykjavik and stay in Old Harbour area

Monday - early morning puffin tour, Golden Circle highlights. Stay at Hotel Selja

Tuesday - Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon and waterfalls

Wednesday - Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon, Diamond Beach, ect. Spend night in Vik

Thursday - Drive back to Reyjavik area, Reykjanes peninsula attractions. Sky Lagoon

Friday - if the flight is later in the day, spend some time in Reyjavik",1,
Post,Fix my agenda: Kids' 6th birthday in June,SadlyNotSpaceballs,2025-01-02 05:31:43,"Hae and happy new year!

I've been to Iceland twice (once solo and once with a buddy) doing Reykjavik, Golden Circle, Silfra snorkeling, Into the Volcano, Snaefellsness, South Coast, Katla, Skaftafell, Jokulsarlon. Never really saw the lights despite 10+ nights over two trips in winter, oh well.

In June, I'm coming back for 4 days this time with my family - wife and twin who will turn 6 our last full day there. Here's the  agenda I have so far. Curious if there's anything you'd change, or any special birthday thing I haven't thought of yet to add. (Also, hotel.) Thanks!

**Day 1 (1/2 Day)**

* Arrive at 3:30pm from Denmark. Rent car.
* Drive to Reykjavik. Explore and shop Laugavegur. Get a hot dog.
* Lava Show at night only planned activity
* Nice dinner. Ice cream from Loki Cafe. Rest.

**Day 2 - Reykjavik Fun**

* Just a few major sites for kids - church, sun voyager, Harpa
* Nexus for birthday present (buy something to do in car next two days)
* Perlan (1-2 hours)
* Lunch at Lebowski Bar
* 4pm - Raufarholshellir tour only time-planned activity
* FlyOver. Maybe Omnom chocolate factory tour if enough time.
* Dinner, rest. (I really want to try Reykjavik Kitchen or Kol... we'll see if kids can do it.)

**Day 3 - Adventure Day**

* 9:30am - Kerid Crater until 10am

* 11:30am - Vestmannaeyjar
* **I have no idea yet about the puffin tour, museum, etc. or how long to spend**
* Kids won't have TONS of energy for walking around, should we take a car?
* I was thinking to leave on 17:00 ferry though I haven't researched it enough yet
* Drive back to Reykjavik
* Birthday dinner and cake if possible **(any suggestions where?)**

**Day 5 (1/2 day)**

* Cinnamon buns from Braud & Co or brunch at Laundromat
* Walk around, do some small things in Reykjavik we skipped above.
* One more hot dog and leave for airport at 1pm

**HOTEL CHOICE**

* I like Reykjavik Lights and appreciate the parking. I guess it will be harder to park in the city center in June though I think we'll manage to find a spot when we need to
* Should I consider Hotel Viking for the kids instead?

OK how did I do planning this one out so far? I don't want to over-pack the trip but I want the kids to see a lot, so trying to find a good balance. What do you think???

Post,Best wildlife viewing in early spring?,Lanky_Astronaut_2772,2025-01-01 19:22:28,"Currently building our itinerary for end of March to beginning of April (I know, cutting it close, I usually prefer to plan trips 6 months out). This was not the priority on selecting our dates but if there's a chance to see some critters I'd love to try to make it happen. 

We're definitely doing Reykjavik and Golden Circle/Southwest. Trying to decide between west or southeast for the remainder of our time (or a whirlwind of both). Probably not going to make it farther north than that on this trip but may come back someday, since I want to go again when I can see puffins and also do more intense hiking than my travel companion can handle or the weather can allow. 

Is there anywhere that would provide a good chance of some cool creatures given these dates? Birds, mammals, I love it all (particularly anything that would be unfamiliar to a Pacific Northwest audience - we probably won't go far out of our way to see orca since they essentially live in our backyard).

Post,Advice for short stay in June,Virtual-Depth-418,2025-01-01 00:30:40,"We're doing a short 2-day stopover on the way back from London to the US and have booked a 2-night stay at a hotel in/near Vik. This will be our second trip and the first time we went, we only made it as far as Vik.

Day 1: Land at KEF at 3:15pm and take a rental car to Vik. We wanted to visit some of the spots we really sped through last time (Skogafoss) and some places we missed last time (Dyrholaey Lighthouse) and maybe check out the Yoda Cave before heading back to the hotel. 

Day 2 is really the only full day we have since our flight will be the next day at 4:45pm. So, the plan was to visit the glacier lagoon + diamond beach and then hit some other highlights while driving back to Vik. 

Any places/experiences we should be sure to do in the way back from Jokulsarlon? We like to do things at our own pace and can't do as much hiking with the 6yo. I saw a 2.5 hr puffin tour but am debating whether it's worth the time/effort. We did a puffin boat tour last time and saw them from afar and my kids are ""eh"" about seeing them again.

We also weren't sure if we should save some things to do the day of our flight. I would rather not risk accidentally missing our flight, so our plan is to drive to KEF from our hotel in Vik and hit one or two locations before getting to the airport by 2 pm.

Comment,,Guide-to-Iceland,2025-01-09 05:49:52,"For your full day exploring from Vik to Jökulsárlón, consider stopping at Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon on your way back. It's a stunning moss-covered canyon with easy viewing platforms, perfect for families with young children. The Skaftafell area of Vatnajökull National Park is also worth a visit, with short, family-friendly trails to waterfalls like Svartifoss. Given your limited time, I suggest skipping the puffin tour if your children aren't particularly excited about it. Instead, consider a quick stop at Fjallsárlón glacier lagoon - it's less crowded than Jökulsárlón but equally beautiful. On your way to the airport on your last day, if you have time for a stop, the Seljalandsfoss waterfall is right off the Ring Road, and you can walk behind it, which is always exciting. Alternatively, the Lava Centre in Hvolsvöllur offers interactive exhibits about Iceland's volcanoes that are great for all ages.

Thursday: Golden Circle. Add Bruarfoss. Tomato restaurant maybe for lunch. Raufarhólshellir. Dinner.

Friday: Puffins. Here's my debate - do a full-day trip, or what I'm leaning to is doing the boat tour which would open things up for Perlan, FlyOver, Nexus, maybe Secret Lagoon. Anything else I'm missing that kids would love?

Iceland is calling me back, and I just booked an 8 day camper van trip for August of 2026
We only got to see the south west over to Vik on our very short trip, so I’m thinking we will focus our energy on the areas we didn’t get to hit last time. 

Here are a few of the things I’ve found and tentatively planned: 

- Diamond Beach & Jökulsárlón (this was my goal for the first trip and a broken down car kept us from getting there)
- Akureyri : Forest Lagoon, would love other suggestions for what to do 
- Látrabjarg cliffs to see the puffins 
-Snaefellsnes peninsula : general plan to be here for the eclipse
- Snæfellsjökul : hoping this is accessible without 4x4 car? 🫣


I wanted to ask all of you seasoned Iceland travelers and Icelanders what we should add to our itinerary! 
Also your favorite camp grounds that you stayed at or ones you’d avoid would be incredibly helpful

we love being outdoors but also appreciate downtime (i.e. the accommodations matter to us), we generally dislike big, crowded, touristy activities, we love food and love to experience culture through food when possible. Also good to know that we rented a car.  
This is our rough itinerary. Would love thoughts on places to stop along the way, best food spots, alternative accommodations, tips, or if we should consider a slight change to the plans: 

Monday: arrive early am and stop at Kokulist bakery. Go to sky lagoon. After sky lagoon drive to Ion adventure hotel and relax. 
Tuesday: snorkel Silfra, explore Thingvellir park. Stay another night at Ion Adventure hotel. 
Wednesday: drive to either Hotel Umi or Hotel Kria (undecided). Leisurely drive and stop and see sights along the way. Explore beach/ do puffin tour if enough time/energy that day. 
Thursday: explore a little more and drive back to Reykjavik in afternoon. Stay at Edition. Thoughts on food? 
Friday: explore Reykjavik. actual anniversary and want to have diner at either Oto, Ox or Dill (undecided). Stay again at Edition. 
Saturday: hit Blue lagoon before airport (if open). If not, do more in Reykjavik.

Comment,,violinniloiv,2024-12-15 13:08:31,"If this is your 10-year anniversary, I'd ball out and try The Retreat Hotel at Blue Lagoon for at least the 2-night minimum before your flight out, which is already near the airport. If not, Silica Hotel and the Retreat Package/day pass are options, as is the Lava Cove which is almost like having your own room at The Retreat and costs a lot less.  It sounds like you are already contemplating Ox, which is nearly $1000 for 2 people (it's also not just 11 seats, I believe now it is 16 or 18) You can also at least do the Sker Package at Sky Lagoon with your own changing rooms since that's your first stop in the country after the bakery. I'd recommend doing the Ingolfshofdi Puffin Tour on the way to or from Vik, I saw 1000's of Puffins there. I am not sure I'd worry so much about the Glass Cottage thing if you aren't there during Northern Lights but if you are, near the ION Adventure Hotel you have the ""Iceland Lakeview Retreat"" which is also 2-night minimum. Most the other ones that are full glass in Hella or Borgarnes, at least Hella is sort of on the way to Vik and has way more privacy, there is not someone else right beside you. Though, the other ""Panoramic"" named ones often have a shared sauna in between. I posted my itinerary for 9 days in January just recently you can check out or let me know if you have any questions.


5 nights, stay in Reykjavik, day 2 is Golden Circle and stay in a Glass Cottage in either Hella or the one by Thingvellir, I'd recommend whichever you pick stay for at least 2-3 nights, then last 2 nights I'd try going over to Blue lagoon's Retreat and have anniversary dinner at Moss (michelin star)",3,

Post,Icelandic Christmas Traditions - The Yule Lads (Jólasveinarnir),misssplunker,2024-12-13 14:03:00,"Happy Friday!

Time for a little bit of Icelandic Christmas lore!

Today, when the Swedes celebrate [St. Lucia](https://sweden.se/culture/celebrations/lucia-in-sweden) by dressing in long, white gowns, wear a candle crown on their heads and bake lussekatter, Icelanders welcome the second of the jólasveinar (Yule Lads) to town - Giljagaur

Many might know that the Yule Lads are 13, arriving from the eve of the 12th of December, until the eve of the 24th (when Icelanders celebrate Christmas - called Aðfangadagur in Icelandic)

In olden times they were more troll-like, stealing, vandalizing and generally being a menace. They are the sons of Grýla and Leppalúði and their house cat is the infamous Jólaköttur (Yule Cat). 

There are a bunch more names for the Yule Lads, and in general the children of Grýla and Leppalúði, but the 13 ones we still anticipate were the ones mentioned in a poem by Jóhannes út Kötlum, called [Jólasveinarnir](https://notendur.snerpa.is/systaoggaui/jolasveinavisa.htm) in the book *Jólin koma* (a classic every Icelandic child must own). The book was published in 1932 and illustrated by Tryggvi Magnússon. The order of the Yule Lads is thus:

1. Stekkjarstaur
2. Giljagaur
3. Stúfur
4. Þvörusleikir
5. Pottaskefill
6. Askasleikir
7. Hurðaskellir
8. Skyrgámur
9. Bjúgnakrækir
10. Gluggagægir
11. Gáttaþefur
12. Ketkrókur
13. Kertasníkir

Their names correspond with one of their ""quirks"", each name indicates either what they like to steal or which prank they like to pull. [Arctic Adventures ](https://adventures.is/blog/the-icelandic-yule-lads/)has a good list of their translated names. 

In modern times, children put one shoe on their windowsill and each one of the Yule Lads brings a little gift each night (a clementine, some candy, small toys, art supplies or books) if they're good or a potato if they're naughty.

The tradition originated with Icelandic fishermen in the 20th century, who sailed in the North Sea and learned about children in the Netherlands putting a stocking up on December 6th. The trend began in the 1930s but didn't get widespread until the middle of the 20th century. In the 60s the tradition became more monolith, with children putting their shoe up on the 11th and the 13 Yule Lads arriving with small gifts

The modern Yule Lads are often associated with Brian Pilkington's illustrations, he has published some books about the Yule Lads but you can see some of his artwork on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=2a50764752e9bb1a&sxsrf=ADLYWIJIn-FXg9cdLeSoqEBQ5qJA1j0-3A:1734098413553&q=yule+lads+brian+pilkington&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0A6bwEop21ehxKWq5cj-cHaJa9t3BrdqzYzrlCn45Xx7cJPyv6ihpvNtDF4DasnrWhUSaR6wqzw3gWfSeKGMWLdDxz_CDdt2kS7hsFOegu6XT-2px37nI-ouvWSQMicayZkReuBr0Z2F2Wq4P-CN20441H6PyGz0LwqDYAH6mZfErB-bp4&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc3sf_86SKAxUz7rsIHdsgGlwQtKgLegQIERAB&biw=1536&bih=695&dpr=1.25). You can also find Christmas tree ornaments and figurines of his depiction of the Yule Lads in most puffin stores

There are many debates about where the Yule Lads live. In Reykjavík, most people believe they live in Esja. In the Mývatn area, they're believed to live in Dimmuborgir, and if you're in the area you can sometimes spot them: [https://www.jolasveinarniridimmuborgum.com/](https://www.jolasveinarniridimmuborgum.com/) . They're dressed rather traditionally there, but you might also be able to spot them in Árbæjarsafn tomorrow: [https://borgarsogusafn.is/vidburdir/bradum-koma-blessud-jolin-joladagskra614942](https://borgarsogusafn.is/vidburdir/bradum-koma-blessud-jolin-joladagskra614942)

There are many great articles online that go into further detail, if you're interested!

Maybe you can even try putting a shoe in the window to see if Stúfur will stop by your window tonight! ",32,8.0

When I planned my visit previously, I also wanted to see both Puffins and Northern Lights. But after some googling, I realised this is improbable.

I have to tell you all that one thing I HIGHLY recommend is the ferry from Landeyjahöfn for a day trip to Heimaey.  I went after the puffins left but i was there to hike Heimaklettur & see the Eldfell volcano and it was gorgeous. Very few people came out throughout the day since the earliest ferry was postponed due to wind & it stayed very windy all day. The only people I saw on my Heimaklettur hike were the workers at the fish processing facilities near the trailhead. Most people were probably smarter than my friends & I & opted to not scale the mountain in the wind. It was easy though. We didn't encounter any other tourists until we finished the hike up Eldfell volcano on the other side of the island.  Rode some Hopp scooters from the fish factories across town to Eldfell & stopped by a bakery en route for lunch.  Its up there for the highlight of my trip.

Post,Puffin photography spots in June,d0ughb0y1,2024-12-02 20:10:45,"Planning on an Iceland trip in June. Main objective is puffin and landscape photography.

Planning to go to Borgarfjörður Eystri. This does not travel through F road right? Planning to stay there one night.

Westman Island. Do you recommend day trip or ferry the car and stay a night on Westman Island?

Any other puffin sites good for photography?

I've read for some sites (Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg?), puffins are on a cliff and quite far, so thinking not ideal for photography.

Thanks",2,7.0
Comment,,puffin-net,2024-12-02 20:30:07,Reynisfjara (one of the black sand beaches on the south coast) has puffins nesting above the basalt columns. You would need a telephoto lens but you can get some amazing shots by standing next to the columns at low tide and pointing up at the birds in flight.,1,
Comment,,BionicGreek,2024-12-03 01:54:40,Best photos of puffins I was able to take were in the westfjords and on Grimsey to the north. Do an overnight up there. Book early though as there are limited lodgings,1,

Comment,,hertziceland,2024-12-03 09:15:50,"You're right about Borgarfjörður Eystri; it’s a great choice and doesn’t involve F roads, so you’ll have a smooth drive. Staying overnight is a good idea to catch those early morning and late evening shots when the light is just perfect.

For the Westman Islands, if you can spare the time, I'd recommend staying the night rather than just doing a day trip. It gives you more flexibility to explore and photograph the puffins and the stunning landscapes there without rushing. Plus, the sunset and sunrise are spectacular!

You mentioned Dyrhólaey and Látrabjarg; indeed, puffins can be a bit far on the cliffs which might challenge photography without a good zoom lens. If you're looking for other sites where the puffins might be easier to photograph, consider places like Akurey, Stórhöfði in Vestmannaeyjar, and Tjörnes Peninsula near Húsavík for some fantastic opportunities.

If you want more detailed tips on locations and how to make the most out of your puffin photography with a rental car, check out our guide on[ Where to see puffins in Iceland with a rental car](https://www.hertz.is/iceland-nature/puffins-in-iceland-self-drive-tips/).

This is the place where you can photograph them in very close proximity. There are plenty of them. Some are so near that you can even touch them (although you absolutely should not!). You don't need to drive through any F-roads to get there. But you would need to drive into some higher grounds so you'll just need to drive carefully and slow down as necessary.",2,

Feedback Appreciated!,Early-Weather9183,2024-11-20 17:11:35,"Helllooo :) I'm planning a 12-day self-drive trip to Iceland in early May with a friend and we have put together an itinerary based on all the reddit posts and random google blogs that I could read.

What we definitely want to get out of our trip is seeing a lot of whales, puffins, the vast expanse of scenery in iceland, do a lot of hiking and eat good food along our way. And any hidden gems would be a bonus. This is our first trip to iceland. We also want to make sure we are not rushing through things and have buffer to just chill in a place if we are liking the place.

I’d love feedback on whether this plan is realistic, if I’m missing anything crucial, or if any activities could be rearranged for better flow. And of course, any new inputs are welcome! :D

Post,9 Day Itinerary for next Summer - Please Critique,SomePlaceToBe,2024-11-05 00:25:22,"Hi y’all, me and my friend are planning a trip to Iceland next summer. Our plan is to travel counter clockwise on Ring Road over 9 days, but not necessarily see every sight. We’ve gotten most of our research from this subreddit and come up with a rough daily breakdown of where we are going and where we are staying and would love it if y'all could provide some thoughts, feedback or advice!

Some context about us:

* We plan to alternate driving as fairly as possible
* We plan to rent some 4x4
* We plan to pack light and essentially find new accommodations each day as we drive around Ring Road
* We are fairly active and enjoy being outdoors
* We want to see as much as we can but don’t mind if we end up missing something we planned during a day
* Some days we would like to be more chill and some days we don’t mind not being chill at all, I guess having some balance is nice
* We are very excited to take in the views of Iceland and also see some Puffins

Questions we have:

* How realistic is our plan?
* Advice for adjusting to varying weather conditions (summer time)
* Really any advice y’all may have that would make this trip a better experience for us

Post,Itinerary help (Thank you!) - August 2025 // 17 days,T_alwaysonholiday,2024-10-17 18:04:48,"Hello!

I have spent the past few weeks working through the many reddit posts to pull together our two week itinerary. We're flying in from the UK and planning to rent a car. On the car - my understanding is we need a 4x4 due to the handful of F-roads involved on this trip - **is that correct?**

We're well travelled, in our 30s and not particularly budget conscious as this is a dream bucket list trip for us. We're big into food - from casual to fine dining and have included a restaurants I have found through this subreddit - but open to recommendations! We're up for hikes (think a couple of hours vs a day event) but are not avid or regularly hikers. We are reasonably fit and active and will of course pack correctly!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1 - Fly into Reykjavik mid-morning / afternoon  
Dinner at Skál!

Anything overrated / over hyped that would be better skipping?

Post,Should I change my flights to September?,wegl13,2024-10-08 19:07:04,"I am going to admit, I think yalls pics the past couple of days RUINED me. I got super excited a week ago and bought tickets for June 8-20 of next year because there's a new, inexpensive nonstop from my home city. I have booked places to stay all around the Ring Road as well as snorkeling, horseback riding, and whale watching.

I picked June because I was hoping to decrease the risk of cold+rain (I have good clothes but man, I hate being both cold and wet), and wanted to see puffins and wildflowers. HOWEVER, the aurora pics are driving me nuts now, because I know the odds of seeing them are nil in June, and reading about how bad the crowds are from everyone's ""September is the best time to go"" posts are making me sad (even though I think our longer drive around the Ring Road will keep us mostly away from the absolutely packed crowds).

It's $500 to change flights. Can someone please tell me to stay with the June dates? It seems like if this goes well, a shorter return trip to just hunt the lights might be reasonable?",9,32.0

And so much birdlife (I love the drumming sound Hrossagaukur/Snipes make as they fly through the air-- the first time I heard it I thought honestly thought it was a space alien).

Seeing the aurora can be awesome, but this past June we witnessed whales breaching under the midnight sun in Eyjafjörður outside of Akureyri, which was just as incredible. To me, Iceland is the land where amazing things can happen at any time, which is what makes it so magical in any season.",8,

We instead made it a thermal pool tour, did the south and added Vestmannaeyjar to our plans which we will never regret.

Post,"TRIP REPORT: Sept 18-29 Ring Road + West Fjords in camper, plus a little extra",meowkittykat2652,2024-10-03 21:46:42,"Day 1 – arrive at KEF @ 6:00am via Icelandair.  Flight was warm, as others have mentioned.  The entertainment, WIFI and charging in the seat backs was not working, so the flight was a little restless.  Arrived at Cozy Campers at 9:00am via private transfer booked through Cozy Campers and picked up our camper van.  We had reservations at Sky Lagoon at 10:00am thinking it would help refresh us after a seven-hour flight.  I think it did the trick.  We did the seven-step ritual and enjoyed the warm water.  It was very crowded and busy.  We spent about 2 hours or so here.  

We then headed to a grocery store and then hit the road toward Landmannalaugar campground where we spent our first night.  This was a long drive to add on to all the travel (3 hours or so) but we took out time, and enjoyed the scenery.  This route did require driving on a 4x4 road with two water crossings.  There was a spot to park/camp before the water crossings if those make you nervous.  We had a quick and simple dinner and went right to sleep at dark. Total time awake was about 36 hours or so.  Around 11:30pm I woke up and had to use the restroom.  Snow was blowing, it was dark, it was chilly.  The toilet was freezing. I came out of the rest room a few minutes later to clear sky and low wind and northern lights!  This was our first of three nights seeing them on our trip.

Day 2 – We originally planned to do a hike this day since we were waking up near trail heads in Landmannalaugar.  However, after a very long day and half of travel without sleep, we slept in and soaked in the natural hot spring river instead. This was an excellent choice and might have been our favorite of the hot springs we went to. A true 10/10 experience.  It was the hottest water we soaked in the whole trip, and we spent about one-hour in the water with only two other people nearby.  We left Landmannalaugar and took our time heading to Reykholt, for reservations at Friðheimar Tomato Farm. This was also an excellent experience and our first real meal since arriving in Iceland. We ordered several dishes and had a marvelous time.  Everything was absolutely excellent.  We then drove another hour to spend the night at Hvolsvöllur campground, had an early night.

Day 3 – Got an early start to the day and left the campground at 7:00 for a day of the South Coast and waterfalls.  We hit to Seljalandsfoss first just before tour busses arrived.  We walked down the trail and found Gljufrabui and had it all to ourselves.  Walking back to the parking lot we passed lots of others heading to Gljufrabui and by the time we got back to the parking lot there were several tour busses and lots of people. We headed to Skogafoss next, and after spending some time down low, we made the trek up the stairs to enjoy the view from up high.  We then spent about two and a half hours hiking the Fimmvorduhals trail, which was beautiful.  The farther we went the more we had to all to ourselves. The weather was fair, and the wind was low.  Heading back toward Skogafoss and the parking lot the sun came out which made it all the better.  We continued on to Vik and had lunch at a brewery after a very busy morning. We took the afternoon to backtrack slightly to Reynisfjara and spent about an hour or so there walking the beach and taking photos.  We spent the night at the Vik campground which was by far the fullest campground we stayed at on our trip.

Day 4 – We had a glacier tour early in the morning out of Vik with Troll Expeditions.  Our original itinerary had us doing a different Ice Cave Tour departing out of the Jökulsárlón area, but that was canceled (we totally understood why) and Troll gave us options to reschedule out of other locations or cancel all together.  We chose to reschedule for the Katla Ice Cave Tour leaving from Vik. Our Tour departed at 7:30. It was short, sweet, very good scenery, our guide was fun, and we were back in Vik by 10:30.  We gassed up, and hit the road for Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach where we had lunch and spent about two hours.  We had stop or two along the way.  Our destination for the night was Hofn, where we had an excellent dinner in town and camped for the night. 

https://preview.redd.it/ykpkr6er2msd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11ffe15b65bbf85726cb79134008c032214de0f1

Day 5 – We got an early start for a long day of driving, pulling away from the campground around 7:30am.  To anyone doing the drive from Hofn to Akureryi, it is totally do able, but please know this is a long day.  We stopped at the Viking Café for coffee before hitting the road.  We did not go to Stokksnes because it was cloudy, and we had time constraints. We planned for a stop at Studagil Canyon which was about halfway along the drive.  The turn off of Road 1 is not paved for the east side parking lot.  Again, fine for us, but we did see two cars tipped off the side of the road.  It was a clear day, no poor weather.  Getting to the Canyon is a bit of a walk once you make it to the parking lot, more so if you must park in a different lot before the 4x4 road.  There were quite a lot of people here, maybe because we hit it around mid-day.  We spent about 1 hour here, give or take 15 minutes.  We made sandwiches and had lunch in the parking lot, switched drivers and continued to Akureyri.

https://preview.redd.it/nvva4zfz2msd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0628d8d08f93b218e6d8d0c6945a7094c70515db

We arrived in Akureyri around 5:00pm.  For our stay in Akureyri, we reserved a guest house with laundry facilities so we could reset and refresh in the middle of our road trip. We stayed in the guesthouse all three nights we were in Akureyri.  We had an early dinner walking distance from our guesthouse and then went to Forrest Lagoon and spent about 2.5 hours there.  This was my second favorite of the hot springs.  There were a good number of people here, but it did not feel as crowded as Sky Lagoon and was very enjoyable.  We left around closing and saw northern lights from the parking lot!

Day 6 – Rest day.  Spent the day exploring around Akureyri, went to the botanic gardens, went to the Christmas Store (this was skippable to us in hindsight), did some shopping and walking around.  Two Cruise ships docked this day, so town was a little full, but good people watching and everyone was pleasant.  We had dinner and did a tasting menus at Mulaberg on the suggestion of a bartender in town.  It was very good.  The weather for the next day was forecasted to become increasingly stormy, so during dinner we also corresponded with North Sailing to rearrange our Whale Watching tour at their recommendation.  Tours out of Husavik were cancelled (our original tour) and we were rescheduled for the 10:00am tour out of Árskógssandur instead, which was 30 minutes north of town.

Day 7 – Morning whale watching excursion out of Árskógssandur with North Sailing.  This was by far our worst weather day.  It was cloudy, windy, and rainy.  We did see some whales though, so overall a successful outing.  We spent the afternoon finishing up laundry and getting things in order for hitting the road the next day and having a cozy night in while it was stormy outside. We got burgers to-go from Taste which was a quick walk from out guest house and very delicious.

Day 8 – Left Akureryi to head to Holmavik, and our ultimate destination of Drangsnes.  The drive was beautiful with snowcapped mountains from the storm the day before.  Waze took us on an unexpected detour that added an hour to our dive but we got to see a little extra of the West Fjords and had gas to spare.  We arrived in Holmavik around 2:30, and went to the Witchcraft Museum, which was very interesting and worth a stop if you are into that kind of thing.  We probably spent a little over an hour here, and then pushed on to Drangsnes.  The hot pots by the sea were empty, so before heading to the campground, we parked, paid (there is a credit card machine here), and soaked for about an hour or so.  As time passed, a few more people joined, and we left as a group was arriving.  Camped at Drangsnes campground.  We were the only ones.  We saw northern lights this night that they were nothing short of spectacular.  We saw faint lights just after sunset, and as the night went on they became stronger and stronger spreading across the while sky.  I believe the KP index that night was a 4, and there was not a cloud in the sky, very little wind.  It was amazing and we had it all to ourselves as the only campers that night.

Day 9 – Left drive Drangsnes campground around 8:30am, gassed up in Holmavik, and headed to Dynjandi.  The scenery on the drive was spectacular.  The West Fjords seemed to be in it’s peak fall moments.  Spent about an hour or so at Dynjandi.  There is a bit of a hike if you are feeling up for it to get close to the falls.  Had lunch in the parking lot and then a 30 minute drive the Ferry dock.  I thought it would be fun to take the Ferry from the WF to Snæfellsnes, but we were very early for the Ferry time and we could have driven and arrived in Stykkishólmur much earlier had we not had Ferry reservations.  However, we were on vacation, so we stopped in Flókalundur, had some coffee and pie at the restaurant which was closing for the season in five days,  and then parked at the Ferry dock and laid down in the back of our van for an hour and a half with the heater keeping us Cozy.  In hindsight, the Ferry is rather skippable and we would not do this again.  We arrived in Stykkishólmur around 8:00pm and then had an excellent dinner at Sjávarpakkhúsið.  We did make a reservation a few weeks in advance.  Highly recommend.  Everything was fantastic and very reasonably priced.   We camped at Stykkishólmur camping ground which was probably the least clean and our least favorite of the campgrounds.

Day 10 – Got a bit of an early start, and spent the day driving  around Snæfellsnes Peninsula before heading back to Reykjavík.  In hindsight, I would have liked to have spent a day Stykkishólmur.  It seemed like a very cute fishing town.  Our first stop was Kirkjufell.  It was cloudy and the top third was obscured by clouds.  We spent about an hour hoping a little more of the mountain would reveal itself, but no luck.  We drove on to Búðakirkja (which was beautiful) and then went to Ytri Tunga.  Not many seals on the rocks, but we could see activity far out offshore.  After this stop we seemed to be ready to end our road trip and relax.  The Snæfellsnes area seems very doable for a day trip, as the things to see and do are very close together compared to other parts of Iceland and within an hour or two of Reykjavík.  We notified Cozy Campers we would be a few hours early returning our van.  We checked into our guesthouse first, moved all our personal items from the van to the guest house, filled the van with gas and swept out the dirt and returned the van.  This was relatively easy and quick.  Maybe 30 minutes or so.  We asked Cozy Campers to call us a taxi to take us back to our guesthouse.  We decompressed for a little and then went to dinner reservations at La Primavera, which was about a 20-minute walk.  Dinner was excellent, but no feel or taste of Iceland (it’s an Italian restaurant and we didn't necessarily expect that).  We made the booking based on the Down to Earth Episode on Iceland and our mouths watering as they did a little story on the restaurant.  Again, the food was great, but we were within much closing walking distance to a lot of other spots that were probably much less expensive and just as good of dining.  It seemed to be a special local spot though as there was a family birthday celebration and another special occasion dinner for what looked like some local Icelandic families.

Day 11 – Spent the day exploring Reykjavík, visiting tourist shops on and near Rainbow Street. Dinner reservations at Dill.  Our experience was excellent.  We did the tasting menu with wine pairing.  It was about $300 USD/person which is on par with the only other Michelin star restaurant I have been to.  The experience, the service and the food were all outstanding. On the way home we stopped in to a restaurant our guesthouse host recommended.  We regretted this after.  We were riding a high from our Dill experience an wanting to try a few more things specific to Iceland before we left the next day.  I believe the second restaurant  was called Tapas Barinn.  It was very loud and crowded, and our server forgot about our table.  The food was good, we ordered the Icelandic lobster and puffin, but it felt overpriced both for food and drink.  We spent about $120 USD for one drink per person (so two drinks) and two small plates, which to me didn’t feel worth it.  My companion wasn’t bothered but we left because they wished to order another drink and our server never returned.  After about 10 minutes we gave up, paid and went home. 

Day 12 – We got some coffee and pastries, got our packing in order and decided to make the 2km trek to the central bus station and take the Flybus to the airport instead of figure out a private transfer.  My ability to make calls wasn’t working very well and a private transfer was between $120-$150 USD.  The Flybus was something like $25 or $30 USD.  The walk felt long rolling our suitcases and carrying backpacks, but it was along the lake and over in about 25 minutes.  The Flybus was strait forward, and we got to the airport with lots of time to kill before our flight home.  We stopped at the Tax Refund window.  Fill this paperwork out in advance.  It’s very simple and makes the process at the airport much easier.  We had about 3 hours to kill before our flight home, so we played cards and passed the time.

Final Thoughts:

Highlights: Landmannalaugar hot springs river, Friðheimar Tomato Farm, dinner at Sjávarpakkhúsið, northern lights sightings, the town of Akureyri, my little painting by a local artist from Akureyri Art Museum gift shop, my Icelandic Blanket from the Hand Knitting Association and little wool elves for friends and family.

Cozy Campers – this was a just fine choice.  The van space was a little smaller than expected.  We rented the Highlander III, thinking we would appreciate the extra space (it can seat and sleep three and we were two).  However, the extra sleep space compromised storage space and this was a challenge. We liked the moon roof and extra windows provided as it did help it feel less claustrophobic.  The heater worked like a champ at night and the only nights we were cold were because we were trying to figure out a good heat setting.  The customer service was fine.  I personally would have appreciated a little more handholding from Cozy, but we got along just fine with the attention we were given. While I think doing a camper and cooking most of your meals can save you money on your trip, our goal was flexibility, so this trip report isn’t about doing things as cost effectively as possible.  We did see lots of people with less expensive campers and even tents and eating cost effective meals from grocery stores.  It’s very doable to do this trip less expensively.

Weather – we were able to pack so much in because we got unbelievably lucky with the weather.  Most of our time was dry and low to moderate winds and we had just as many sun days as cloudy.

Rain/Wind layer – this is crucial. We are from Colorado, used to all four seasons and all the weather in between.  The ability to block the bite the wind has is the key to staying warm.   Some days I only wore my rain pants, and light sweatshirt and rain jacket and was just fine. We both packed lots of lighter layers.  The times I was chilly were little pit stops on the road where I got out without my rain/wind layer and the breeze or wind just cuts right through you.

Waterproof boots were also very valuable and necessary for waterfalls, hiking, and when it rained, and things got a little muddy.  You want the ability to walk through whatever is on the ground, not dance around it to save your socks. Get the proper shoes.

Layers – look up proper layering techniques so you don’t over or under pack if this is important to you.  Make sure things are sweat wicking and breathable.  Days where I layered most I had an all season sweat wicking base layer, a midweight breathable second layer, breathable fleece layer, puffy layer, rainproof/water proof layer on my top half.  Bottom half Kari Traa wool base layer bottoms, water resistant hiking pants from REI, and rain pants.

Northern Lights photographing – doing a little research before your trip goes a long way on this and this sub is a wealth of information.  All my photos are from my iPhone 14 Pro.  Lights were photographed in night mode with 3 seconds exposure.

  
English and credit cards - credit card machines are literally everywhere, even if you are going somewhere remote and expecting there to be an on-your-honor system.  The system will be electronic.  Everyone spoke English except a few interactions in the WF. Even then, we could still communicate fine and it was never a significant issue. ",5,4.0
Post,Help us choose our 2025 trip dates! Late August or mid September?,nyxsyn1,2024-09-29 15:23:46,"We are planning a trip for September next year! We saw somewhere that new moon with darker skies make for better chance of aurora, how true is it?

With the new moon next year occuring at 23Aug & 22Sep, we are considering between (1) 26Aug-6Sep and (2) 9Sep-20Sep. 

Option#1 would allow a slight chance of seeing the puffins too but would it be too early in the season to catch northern lights? Option #2 might get us a higher chance of catching it but at risk of bad weather? Is it cutting too close to winter driving conditions? We could do a week earlier too but just trying to avoid full moon on 8Sep, how much does this matter?

Help us decide! Which would you choose? Any other considerations? Any tips are welcome! We are so excited seeing all the aurora photos here and cant wait to start planning.",1,11.0
Comment,,NoLemon5426,2024-09-29 16:28:36,"The risk of 'bad weather' is any time of year, the difference between these dates is normally insignificant so don't worry about this. The wintry weather this year is definitely early, with early September usually being quite summery still. Puffins will likely only be around in Heimaey, *maybe* some in or around Vík. I also would not plan around the moon phase.

Honestly, just pick the dates that work best for you and whatever else is happening in life. If you're camping or using a van I would pick the earlier dates since nearly all campsites should still be open. If you aren't camping or using a van, please do not use AirBnB or other short term rentals* which has done measurable and demonstrable damage to the housing market for Icelanders. Housing is already strained and then with the entire town of Vík being displaced less than a year ago + immigration issues, lots of Icelanders have no where to live. Use hotels and guesthouses which are intended very specifically for travelers.

We did catch the Aurora.  The new moon did help us see a kp1 show.  Although, the week before and after also had great showings based on the posts on this sub.  That said, it's not a guarantee.  We spoke to some folks who were  there the same time we were who didn't see them.",1,

Post,"Short Westfjords Trip Review
",mlke,2024-09-17 15:41:38,"I recently took a trip to Iceland and used this subreddit as a good source of info to plan our West Iceland adventure, so I wanted to give back and leave a review of our itinerary as it seemed like documented Westfjord experiences are far fewer than those of other, more popular areas. In total I had 9 days for the entire trip and did about 3 days there. I’ll list off each day to give a sense of the actual logistics, but will only go into detail for those 3 days. 

Biggest take-aways: driving in the Westfjords was not that scary and definitely does not need a 4x4 IF you stick to the double numbered roads. Two crucial decisions also made this a piece of cake from a driving perspective. First- doing the trip clockwise. Doing it counterclockwise puts you on the outer lane along most of the fjords, which seems like a totally different experience if you’re a little nervous about that. Second may be more controversial but they wouldn’t have fit into this timeline anyways, and it’s skipping two of the most talked about attractions- Látrabjarg and Rauðisandur Beach. See below for more details!

—-------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1 - Reykjavik 

Day 2 - South side of Snæfellsnes Peninsula

Day 3 - North side of Peninsula and Westfjords

After waking up in Olafsvik we slowly made our way to Stykkishólmur to take the Ferry Baldur to the Westfjords at 3 pm. It turned out to be a great time frame that let us explore the northern half of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula a bit. Getting onto the ferry was super easy- just scan your ticket and drive into the ship’s hull. We got a bit of motion sickness with the swells in the first half, but were fine in the second half of the trip. A post here actually reminded me that the ferry is still subject to the whims of nature and could be canceled if the weather is really bad…so consider an alternative route if you want to be extra safe! As to the ferry itself- there was lots of room to spread out and even lie down and sleep in the ship’s seated areas. Once we docked on the other side we hit up a hot spring and stayed in Patreksfjörður for the night. Coming down off the mountains into that first fjord was the only time I felt really nervous driving (for about 3 minutes). Being on the outer lane with no guard rail and high visibility to the bottom was slightly vertigo-inducing but it was the only time I really felt that way, and the road was completely empty (and paved). Going slow and focusing on the road is the best thing to do and you’ll be fine. In general the roads here were wide and empty. 

Touching on Látrabjarg and Rauðisandur Beach- we would not have had the time to get there and do much after taking the 3 pm ferry and landing in the Westfjords at about 5:30 pm. Based on the distances and gravel roads I would guess it would take over half a day to visit both without a lot of wandering around. Those roads also seemed like the roads people complain about the most, but honestly after having traveled the island I think I could have tried them (they are not F-roads). Overall though I still got a good feel for the area and still enjoyed it without getting to these spots. 

Day 4 - Dynjandi & Ísafjörður

We woke up in Patreksfjörður and headed clockwise around highway 63. The road turned to gravel a little past Bíldudalur, and had a consistent amount of small potholes all along the coast. We just went slow but that was fine because the views were great. I think everyone who caught up to us ended up passing us, which was fine. The road condition was nothing worse than what I experienced getting to Brúarfoss in the golden circle, and I imagine even a lower clearance vehicle could have managed. This road eventually gained elevation but didn’t seem that difficult up into the mountains. It did however feel SPOOKY at times- when the fog gets thick and you haven't seen anyone for 20-30 minutes at the top of a martian landscape, it's a bit of a thrill- but not necessarily difficult to drive through. So that was really the end of the driving difficulty, as once you connect back to highway 60 it is paved or at least in the process of being paved- and pothole free. 

We got into Dynjandi around 11 maybe? I was surprised to see it teeming with tourists. For how remote the areas around it feel, it was interesting to see a steady stream of tour buses bringing people in and out. Still enjoyable but understand it may be crowded. From here we drove north to Ísafjörður. This is the part of the drive where you can begin to trust google maps estimates again. We stopped into Flateyri where we also encountered tour buses haha! We then continued through the single-lane tunnel to Ísafjörður (going north the way we did gives you the right-of-way and the other cars pull over, another plus of going clockwise for this trip). We arrived right when a cruise ship was docked, so it felt a little hectic with people flocking for the stores, but most people completely vanished back onto the ships by the time we ate dinner. The town was nice even if most places had really limited hours. 

Day 5 - More fjords back towards Borgarnes

We woke up, went to a cafe and got on the road. Driving south around the final set of fjords was yet another unique experience. All the way to Holmavik was really cool actually- mountains turned to rolling hills and unusually more desolate landscapes. We had a few stops along the way including two trails and a seal outlook. From Holmavik we continued south towards the southern coast and got a hotel just north of Borgarnes. The terrain continued to be beautiful so the driving was not bad, even if it was one of our longest driving days.

Day 6 - Golden Circle

Day 7-9 Southern Coast then back to Keflavik Airport

—-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall it was a great trip, and I was relieved that the Westfjords were easy to navigate. If I were to go back I would try a little harder to find more places to get out of my car and explore- perhaps stopping at the beach and puffin cliffs I mentioned earlier. Perhaps stopping in Þingeyri, or just following gravel roads out to the tips of the fjords more often (according to F-road restrictions). I think finding these places to explore is not as obvious and well-documented as it is in the US, but it makes finding them a little more special. 

Other random tips: turn on the terrain feature on google maps to more accurately predict where the road will gain elevation and what you’ll be driving through. I saw Siminn mentioned a lot here as the sim card to purchase, but the airport didn’t have them so we bought Nova. That worked out everywhere we went so their network coverage was fine. Food and Gas were big expenses. I picked up some Hardfiskur (dried fish jerky), with bread and butter, which was my go-to lunch whenever we didn’t stop at a restaurant. It was ok at first, then I actually really liked it lol. It's important to also check the closing times of grocery stores if you plan on eating cheap. Somtimes we would end our day at around 7 and find most places closed- especially around saturday/sunday. Overall I spent $1500 across 9 days not including the expenses for the actual car rental and lodging. ",5,7.0

Post,Trip Report – July 26 – Aug. 10 - Long & Detailed,ameliachester,2024-09-14 21:21:19,"https://preview.redd.it/n1sabb7sfuod1.jpg?width=694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9400c7c01e76101d5511d8588bdbf7beabde917

I returned from my second trip to Iceland over a month ago and am finally getting around to writing this. It was amazing, of course! And it was also a great learning experience. I really had to heed the advice I see repeated here about how to prepare for disruptions. It didn’t all go as planned but I wouldn’t change a thing. We’re for sure going to be back.

I traveled with my partner; I’m in my late 40s and he’s in his late 50s. We’re not super athletic but we do shorter hikes pretty regularly. We rented a 4WD vehicle, and my partner did all the driving. (I don’t yet have a full driver’s license, just a motorcycle license. Getting my full license would be helpful, but I don’t think I’d be up for driving in Iceland as a relatively new driver… it will be a few years before I can help out.) We visited Iceland in April 2023 for 9 days during which we hit most of (but not all of) the popular south coast points of interest we wanted to see as well as Westman Islands, Snaefelsness Peninsula, the Golden Circle, and Reykjavik. With 15 days this time, we planned to do the entire ring road and the Westfjords, without spending too much time in areas we’d already been to but making a bit of time for a few sites we’d missed. [I made a previous post about our accommodations](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1epslpp/accommodation_reviews_information/) so I’ll be brief about them here.

 Day 1 – Arrival. Arrived at KEF after an overnight flight from Toronto. The flight left at 11 pm so I’d hoped we’d both be super tired and able to sleep pretty normally on the plane, but no such luck. We arrived at about 9 am and had an easy time getting through the airport and picking up our car at Blue. I really wanted to see Hvammsvik and this was out of the way but the only day we could really fit it in. It was probably not a great idea to do so much driving after so little sleep. On our first trip, Day 1 was salvaged by jumping into the Blue Lagon right away, and next time I’d opt for a closer public pool as our first stop. We stopped at the Bonus in Keflavik to pick up a few groceries and snacks and then some delicious and missed gas station sandwiches before driving to Hvammsvik spa for our 2:30 reservation. It was a beautiful drive on a sunny day and the roads were good, but we were soooo tired. It was a relief to get in the water. There were about 5 or 6 hot pots in a beautiful natural setting, and we did the cold plunge in the Atlantic ocean, which definitely helped to wake us up! It was fairly busy, but not super crowded. Lots of beautiful people and it felt very, very spa-like. Luxurious and lovely, but I think my next trip will be much more focused on public pools and hotpots we find in the wild. We drove to our accommodations at Farmhotel Efstidalur, where we’d stayed one night during our first trip, and which we had loved. We splurged and ordered the dinner special at the restaurant there – roast beef dinner. It was delicious and so filling we couldn’t even finish it. We slept early and well.

 Day 2 – Landmannalaugar. Enjoyed an excellent breakfast at the farmhotel before heading out to Landmannalaugar. We drove the northern route to avoid river crossings. It was a long but beautiful drive. We stopped at the Highland Centre to use the washroom just before beginning the much anticipated F208. This road is nuts. I have never been on a road like this in my life. We stopped at Sigoldugljufur Canyon, which was an easy 15 minute walk from the parking lot. Really beautiful canyon in the middle of a desolate volcanic landscape. I just couldn’t believe the rest of the drive. I kept thinking, “Really?! We’re allowed to drive here?!” It’s not a gravel road; it’s a ROCK road. The car and I were shaking during much of the trip, but we didn’t see much traffic and could drive slowly and let people pass. It became a more reasonable gravel road as we neared Langmannalaugar, and the only actually kind of scary bit was right at the end, on a very narrow road with more height and no guardrails. Most of the drive was just weird and uncomfortable but not scary. As we approached the park there was someone there to check our parking reservations, which we had made several months earlier. We parked in the lot right before the river crossing which we were definitely not bold enough to attempt. It’s just a quick 5 minute walk over the river to the campground. There are great washroom facilities and an information kiosk where you can buy maps, snacks, and other necessities. It’s beautiful. Already, I could see a colourful mountain in the background. We decided to just do the lava field hike, which still took a couple of hours as we like to take our time and stop at all the lookouts. It’s definitely easier than climbing a mountain (which we had debated), but not without its challenges. We did the loop counterclockwise. There was a bit of an incline at the beginning, but mostly the hike is level and easy for anyone. Near the end of the hike there was a lot of scrambling over rocks (lava!} which was awesome but would be challenging or impossible for folks with mobility issues. The scenery was out of this world. We were lucky to be there on a fairly sunny day. Painted mountains in the background, black lava rocks in the foreground, it was like nothing I’ve ever experienced before and was absolutely worth the completely bonkers road trip. Afterwards, my partner soaked in the hot springs with a tonne of other people, but I felt too uncomfortable to get changed out in the open to partake myself. If this had been Day 15 instead of Day 2 I probably would have done it, but still not comfortable enough. He thoroughly enjoyed it. The drive back felt easier and definitely less exciting. We decided to have dinner at the Highland Centre as it was getting late and we were worried we might not make it back to the farmhotel in time for dinner. The dinner menu was pretty expensive, but they let us order burgers off the daytime menu even though it was past the cut off time. They were good burgers and not too outrageously priced. We slept well but knew we had to make a big decision in the morning,

 Day 3 – Change of Plans. We’d learned the previous day that part of the ring road had been closed due to flooding and it seemed like it would take a while to repair. We had to decide if we were going to continue on to the south coast as planned and cross our fingers or forfeit the next couple of nights, find new accommodations on the other side of the country instead, and head in the opposite direction to save most of our reservations. We gave ourselves until after we finished another delicious farmhotel breakfast to make the call and decided finally to drive north to the Akureyri area. We had planned a 1.5 hour drive to Skogafoss where we were going to do a part of the hike above the falls (we had climbed to the top on our first trip but hadn’t done the hike because our day was so packed, but missing this hike was our biggest regret!) before taking it easy at our amazing sounding and much anticipated stay at The Garage. It was gonna be a lovely and chill day. Instead, I scrambled to book a new hotel for the next two nights and to see what I could do about getting refunds for the two nights we had to cancel. (The Garage refunded us – THANK YOU! The other place did not. Neither of them were under any obligation to do so.) Then we spent 7 hours driving to a new farmhotel in Laugar. It was not a fun drive. We were just trying to get there to head towards the rest of our itinerary, and didn’t stop for anything except gas and coffee and soup. We followed Googlemaps blindly through some weird backroad in Thingvellir and then weaved through the countryside and the absolute middle of nowhere on unpaved roads for the first couple of hours before we finally caught up to the ring road again. We stopped for gas and some unimpressive meat soup (me) and fish and chips (my partner) at a gas station along the ring road but otherwise we just tried to keep going, knowing we’d be back that way in a few days anyway. We made up some time on the ring road but driving around the mountains in the north was pretty scary for my partner who still wasn’t used to this kind of driving yet. We knew there wasn’t a restaurant at our accommodation, and we were lucky that we arrived just before 8, when the gift shop at Godafoss, directly across the street from our accommodations at Fljotsbakki Farm Hotel, closed. Their hot food was all put away but we managed to grab some sandwiches and muffins for dinner. Our accommodations were okay, but not the place we had been looking forward to and we were so tired and bummed out by the time we got there. It was a hard, disappointing, stressful day.

 Day 4 – The North! We rallied, and we learned a lot, and we made some more changes to our plans. It became pretty clear that my partner did not want to be doing super long drives that were also potentially kind of scary. It was really stressful for both of us. So we took a look at our itinerary and made some changes while we were still able to rebook accommodations with no financial penalty. We decided we’d take the ferry back from the Westfjords to cut out some of the driving and make it so that he was never doing more than 3.5 hours of driving in a day. We cut out the Trollaskagi Peninsula entirely. And we relished the fact that we now had this bonus day in the north to explore some of the things we weren’t supposed to get to for another few days. We got a late start after a mediocre breakfast and ended up having a great day. We drove around part of Myvatn and climbed the pseudocraters (very easy, short trail} before enjoying ice cream at Skutais. It was too windy for midges! We went to the Grotagja cave which was a quick stop – right beside the parking lot, and not too many people ahead of us. We drove further around the lake to the Hverir geothermal area, which was awesome and again left us feeling like we were on another planet. Paths around boiling mudpots, and you could choose to hike to the top of the small mountain overlooking the area. We spent about an hour there. We then went to Dettifoss and Selfoss, which were both amazing. All of these drives were very easy and along paved roads. Note that we went to the main entrance for Dettifoss and Selfoss; I know there is another entrance as well. It was about a km to get to Dettifoss from the parking lot, and the trail is totally easy and flat and through interesting rock formations. Selfoss is worth checking out as well. We stopped at Dalakofinn Utibu in Laugar for a pizza. We thought it was weird that all the pizzas had cream cheese on them, but it was delicious and filling and a pretty affordable meal. Finally, we drove to Godafoss, arriving after the crowds had mostly gone home. The horseshoe falls were right beside the parking lot and were lovely in the dimming light.

 Day 5 – Studagil Canyon. After another mediocre breakfast at Fljotsbakki Farm Hotel we made the 2 hour drive to Studagil Canyon. The roads were easy until we got to the turn off to the canyon itself. Honestly, this was the most unnerving drive of our entire trip! The dirt road was in poor condition, extremely narrow, and took us directly alongside the steep canyon. The road is clearly under construction so I’m sure it will eventually be a smoother ride, but I just felt fortunate we didn’t have rain or much oncoming traffic to contend with. We drove to the east side parking lot closest to the canyon and it was so busy we were lucky to find a spot. Parking was a but chaotic, without clearly defined spots, but everyone was generally respectful There are public washrooms and a small food stand on site. From this parking lot it was a very easy but boring 40-minute walk to Studagil Canyon. It was absolutely worth the treacherous drive. We spent about three hours there, climbing in and around and on the canyon. It was very crowded but everyone was good about looking out for one another. This was a highlight of our trip, for sure. We then drove to Egilsstadir for dinner, and decided to just share a pizza again, as we’d found it a really cost effective and filling meal. This time we just went to a gas station and the pizza was great there, too! Iceland does pizza very well. We were now, finally, back to our planned accommodations. We stayed in a great room at the wonderful Hotel Eyvindara in an Icelandic forest. We soaked in the onsite hot tub and sat outside our room looking at the surrounding trees, almost feeling like we were back at home in Ontario.

 Day 6 – Seydisfjordur. After a delicious hotel breakfast we decided to embrace our newfound less-is-more / we-can’t-see-it-all attitude and forgo our planned Hengifoss hike in favour of just hanging out in the neighbouring town of Seydisfjordur. It was a short half hour drive down a beautiful but, of course, somewhat unnerving mountain road. All paved, though! Our first stop was to check out the sound sculpture, Tvisongur. The googlemap directions were a bit misleading and initially led us into an industrial area we clearly weren’t supposed to be in. We found the path leading from the parking lot though, with a sign indicating a short trek of less than a km, which we were delighted to read. It did, however, turn out to be all up a fairly a steep hill! The path was clearly marked and straightforward. It was a pretty cool sound sculpture, like a domed cement cave with rooms of various sizes. We walked around singing and harmonizing and listening to how the tones changes from room to room before going back into the main town to stroll around. We walked along the harbour, went to the rainbow street, and visited the church before having some tasty lamb soup at The Filling Station, the aptly named gas station restaurant. We went to Skaftfell Art Centre, which was founded by Dieter Ross, an artist my partner was familiar with. There was an exhibit on whales in the gallery upstairs and in the café downstairs there was information about Dieter Ross and the founding of the centre. I found a great book called *The Museum of Whales you will Never See and Other Excursions to Iceland’s most Unusual Museums*, by A. Kenra Greene\*.\* We grabbed a couple of coffees for the road and headed back to Egilsstadir where we did some souvenir shopping. Hus Handanna had a nice variety of souvenirs and prints and I found a beautiful lopeysa at another craft store in town.

 Day 7 – Puffins! After another great hotel breakfast we picked up some groceries at the Bonus in town before making the hour long drive to Borgarfjordar Eystri. At this point it became clear that a lot of what was causing my partner to feel pretty low energy was a bit of a head cold. We had an AMAZING and truly revitalizing bowl of soup at Alfacafe. It came with unlimited bread and refills as well as coffee or tea and was exactly what we needed to give us the strength to carry on to the puffin cliffs. They were awesome. If you care even a little bit about seeing puffins (and I really did care only a very little bit) this is absolutely the place to be. In fact it made me think that perhaps I cared about puffins a whole lot, after all. They were all over the cliffs, just hanging out, occasionally taking flight. Literally within an arm’s reach. SO MANY of them! I couldn’t believe how relaxed they were around the throngs of tourists. We then checked into our most anticipated and favourite accommodations of our whole trip – a studio apartment at Blabjorg Resort. We had intentionally planned a mid-trip vacation-within-a-vacation here, booking it for two nights and knowing we could just stay put and get some laundry done. We did three loads of laundry in the very small washing machine that was in our room and hung our clothes to dry on every flat surface we could find. We crashed early, and my partner got some much needed and restorative downtime.

 Day 8 – Rest Day. Not only was my partner feeling awful, but this was also, astoundingly, the first day we experienced really bad weather. After an amazing on site breakfast we hunkered down watching movies and the storm raged outside. The wind blew our patio furniture off our deck! We made some soup and sandwiches with our Bonus groceries. We had planned to use the onsite spa including outdoor hottubs but decided that was not the way to go given the weather and the way my partner was feeling. The rest day was exactly what we both needed.

 Day 9 – Husavik. My partner woke up feeling so much better, and the weather was again fully cooperative. After breakfast we walked out to the pier by our accommodation and went to see the turf house in the centre of the village before retracing our steps back north. We bypassed Dettifoss this time and went to Aspyrgi Canyon. We did a short hike through the forest and to a couple of lookout spots around the canyon. It was lovely and peaceful. There were people there, but it was far less crowded than most of the places we’d been. From there, we drove to Husavik where we stayed at the Husavik Cape Hotel. Attached to the hotel was the Eurovision Museum, featuring exhibits from the contest as well as the movie of the same name. It was fun (we enjoyed the movie),and was free for all hotel guests. We were hoping to get dinner at the Ja Ja Ding Dong bar but it turned out they didn’t have much of a food menu, so we ate (really good) fish and chips from a take-out place on the harbour. We parked our car back at the hotel and walked the 10 minutes to GeoSea, where we had made 8:00 reservations months ago. The skies were clear and we relaxed in the hot infinity pools overlooking the Atlantic ocean. Perfect way to end the day.

 Day 10 – Akureyri. We had a mediocre hotel breakfast before driving to Akureyri for the day. We decided to take the toll tunnel to save us the stress of more mountain roads, and we’re glad we did. We headed straight for the Christmas House, which was pretty wonderful. The faux gingerbread house had a great selection of ornaments for sale, and there were all kinds of festive treats like hot apple cider and candy apples available. There were elf-sized Christmas houses as well as the world’s largest advent calendar. We then went to Forest Lagoon for our 12:30 reservation. It was lovely and relaxing and in a beautiful setting as well but, again, I think I am now over the spas. It was a civic holiday and there was a big festival going on in town, so lots of people were out and about. We went to the botanical gardens, which were beautiful, and after seeing all the flowers and plants we had some coffee and shared a piece of cake at the café there. We strolled around the town for a bit waiting for the Indian Curry House to open for dinner. (It had been recommended here on reddit). We found a great used bookstore and really enjoyed the feel of the town, including the troll garbage cans and heart stoplights. Dinner was great. We then got back on the ring road and drove to our accommodations in Varmahild.

 Day 11 – Towards Westfjords. We had another great hotel breakfast before getting an early start on our drive towards the Westfjords; we were super nervous about this drive and knew they were calling for rain. After stopping for gas, we began the coastal drive towards Holmavik. It was stunningly beautiful. I was less nervous during the drive than I thought I’d be, though I’m not sure I can say the same for my partner, who was actually doing the driving! (He just chimed in to say he thought this was scarier than Studagil canyon!) Weaving in and out of the fjords along roads that were often gravel, sometimes very high up and with no guardrails was for sure tense at times. We drove through the clouds for about 10 terrifying minutes where we could not see more than about a foot ahead of us! It was so absurd I found myself laughing rather than freaking out, and we both agreed it was probably better that we didn’t know what we couldn’t see! We were so relieved to make it to Holmavik in good time and we checked into our guest house before the weather really hit. We had AMAZING spicy fish soup at the café in the Museum of Witchcraft & Sorcery. The museum was fun to explore as well. We napped in our guesthouse for a bit before having dinner at Café Riis. Pizza again and, again, it was great. We slept well as the rain came down outside.

Day 12 – Isafjordur. We had by far the worst breakfast of our trip. Very North American continental breakfast style but without the crappy eggs and sausages. Basically just storebought bread and jam and cereal. But we knew we’d be eating well in our future. We continued along the coast, both awed and afraid. It was such a beautiful sunny day. We passed several motorcyclists (and regular cyclists! And sheep! I should mention these; both sheep and cyclists are everywhere in Iceland.) We stopped at all the viewpoints and had some cake and coffee at our only opportunity to do so before we got to Sudavik. In Sudavik we went to the Arctic Fox Centre, which was quite disappointing and depressing. The exhibits were alright and somewhat informative. There were two foxes in a cage out back and they did not appear to be injured or anything, but I could be wrong! They looked like they were just prisoners and did not look happy to be there at all. We got into Isafjordur at about 3 pm and checked into our amazing boutiquey hotel. We were both quite hungry but hesitant to ruin our appetite for our highly anticipated dinner reservations at 8:30. We broke down and got some noodle soup at Thai Tawee, and it hit the spot. (We eat a lot of Asian food at home and were really missing noodles and rice at this point in our trip!) I was disappointed to learn the Museum of Everyday Life was closed but we went to the Culture House / public library and looked at the exhibits there. I loved the town. I want to come back and spend several days there. It is so beautiful and laidback and yet seemingly has everything one could need. We had dinner at Tjoruhusid which I had been so excited about for about a year and had made reservations several months ago. I can’t even describe what a wonderful experience it was. The fish buffet was one of the best meals I’ve ever had. It started with a fish soup and was followed by a buffet of about 7 different fresh fish dishes and accompanying vegetables. All the fish dishes tasted different from one another and all were amazing. We ate at long communal tables with other guests with whom we had lovely discussions. It was just great. Just go. I’ll be back for sure.

Day 13 – Killing Time in the Westfjords. After an amazing hotel breakfast we drove to Dynjandi, where we’d been planning to spend several hours. The drive was generally okay, for the Icelandic Westfjords. I’d been really looking forward to seeing Dynjandi and indeed it’s an impressive waterfall. You don’t even have to leave the parking lot if you just want to catch a glimpse, but we had been hoping to do some more exploring and to get closer. Unfortunately, the parking lot was as far as we got, as work was being done on the paths to create or improve the viewing platforms. So we found ourselves with a whole lot of extra time to kill before our ferry arrived and no real desire to stray too far afield and risk missing the ferry. So we decided to just make the drive to the ferry terminal and then see what we could see in the immediate area. This was a super sketchy drive, as there was a lot of construction and detours happening, ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN, so once we made it to the ferry terminal we really weren’t going far! Luckily, we discovered there was a hotpot close by, and we spent an hour soaking there. Beautiful views, and not many people around. We met a family from Poland and a couple form the Netherlands with whom we had nice conversations about our trips. We found a little café in the area that had a geology exhibit in the basement and the woman working there told us there was a lovely beach nearby so we spent some time there. It was quite windy but it was a nice place to kill time and there were some cool rock formations. We went back to the ferry terminal and easily boarded the ferry. We had bought out tickets previously. Note that there is no office on the Westfjords side; all tickets must be purchased electronically. The ferry ride was smooth. We watched the Olympics on the tv on the boat and realized our vacation almost exactly corresponded with the timing of the Olympics, and we had pretty much forgotten they were going on. It felt like a weird reminder of the outside world and that our vacation was getting close to being over. We ate predictably not great burgers and fries from the cafeteria on the ferry. The ferry stopped in Flatey, a car-free island that is apparently great for birdwatching. and I definitely want to stop there myself next time! We got into Stykkisholmur at about 8:30 and checked into our hotel which was just a couple of minutes away.

Day 14 – Return to Snaefellsnes. We spent a full day on Snaefellssnes Peninsula on our first trip but there were a few things we missed. Foremost was Vatnshellir cave, which my partner really wanted to see as he’d loved Jules Verne when he was a kid and knew that the area was the inspiration for *Journey to the Centre of the Earth*. We had also missed Stykkisholmur, so we spent the morning in the town. We took the easy trail to the lighthouse, from which we had a great view of the town, before driving through it, only to stumble onto the Library of Water, which I saw was an exhibit by Roni Horn, whose *Island Zombie* I’d read as recommended here on reddit, and had loved. In order to get into the museum you had to go to another museum to pay admission and get a code to enter the building. This was a super fun adventure in our minds, and so we did. The library is comprised of tubes of water extracted from glaciers throughout Iceland! And the view is amazing. After leaving town, we drove to Vatnshellir cave, where we’d made reservations for the mid-afternoon. We were taken down into the cave with a guide and a group of about 15 other people. We were all given hardhats and flashlights before descending down a spiral staircase into the cave. It was easy and there were lots of kids in attendance. The cave was small but not overwhelmingly so, and dark, so keep that in mind if you’re claustrophobic. I was not nervous, but it was definitely strange after going down the second flight of stairs to be plunged into absolute complete darkness when the guide turned off the lighting. We probably spent about 40 minutes in the cave. After this, we went to Ytri Tunga beach, which we had missed on our first trip. We had to scramble over a lot of rocks to get close to the resting seals, but we got SO close, and it was very well worth it! After the beach we drove to our accommodations at the Fossatun Country Hotel, just outside of Borgarnes. We ate dinner at their on site restaurant, the Rock N’ Troll Café. It was great, and patrons had the opportunity to go through the café’s extensive vinyl collection and find something to play.

Day 15 – Reykjavik. On our last full day, after an awesome hotel breakfast we headed to Reykjavik. It was pride weekend, and we knew we’d miss the big parade happening the next day but thought we’d check out what was going on in the city. We had spent a couple of days exploring down-town on our first trip and this wasn’t a priority on this one. We found the building operating as Pride headquarters, and attended the LGBTQ+ craft market, which included several vendors from within the community. We walked around downtown for a little bit and went to the gift shop at Harpa which we’d remembered being one of our favourite souvenir spots. We then went to find and check into our hotel, Reykjavik Lights by Keahotels, which was a bit outside of downtown. We decided to spend some time at the closest public pool, which was Laugardarslaug. The complex had a regular lane swimming pool as well as a shallow kids pool with slides. There were several hotpots, and even a volleyball court. It was fairly busy but totally relaxing. For dinner, we found some delicious pho at Viet Express Food and then had ice cream from a place in the same plaza.

Day 16 – Departure. After a delicious hotel breakfast we went to the Reykjavik campground/hostel and left our remaining unopened groceries with someone at the office there. They were happy to take them for guests to use in the communal kitchen. It was close to the botanical gardens so we thought we’d walk around there for a bit but we still don’t know if it was just super unimpressive or we were just unable to find the main entrance! We weren’t up for getting wet before out flight but decided to check out Nautholsvik Geothermal Beach, and we’ve definitely added it to the list for future trips. There was one brave person swimming in the ocean and many people enjoying the hotpot on the beach. It looked great. Our last stop before the airport was to a park near the city to see one last waterfall – Kermoafoss. It was a quick 20 minute walk from where we parked, and along a lovely, easy, forested path. We returned our car to Blue about 3.5 hours before our flight and it was super easy. We’d opted for the full insurance so they didn’t have to inspect it for damages. We were able to check our bags, breeze through security, fill our carryons on with last-minute duty free souvenir purchases and grab a bite to eat and we still had lots of time before our 5 pm departure.

Final note: Truly, stay as flexible as you can. And embrace the unexpected! We lucked out with mostly amazing weather, but if we'd followed our original itinerary and waited on the south coast for the ring road to open up, we would have had some awfully messy days. I am sure we would have made the best of them, but we really did have the best time with those extra days up north.

I anticipate several future trips to Iceland. Now that we’ve had a taste of the entire country (except for that stretch between Hofn and Egilsstadir!) I anticipate future trips will each be focused on one region. There is still so much to see! I now devote a good portion of my brain to planning my next Iceland adventure, and it is a pretty fun, if expensive, hobby! Thanks to everyone here for all the great suggestions; this community has been so helpful.",8,1.0
Post,Some feedbacks from our visit,valer85,2024-09-09 11:36:58,"We visited last week, so end of august-beginning of september, and I thought it would be nice for future visitors to share some experience. 

- Scenery is breathtaking, sometimes it seems to be inside a fantasy movie. Google map time is just a rough idea, because you will stop at every corner to take photos.

- it's a good time of the year also for Aurora, it's just a matter of clouds. At 10.30 pm it's dark so if there are no clouds you have good chances to see it (if it's powerful enough). 

- Be prepared to change your itinerary or leave something behind. It's not always true (as I read before going there) that the weather can turn very fast from bad to good, it's more the other way around. We had 3 days of rain and it NEVER stopped. The clouds/fog made impossible to see anything, so we had to skip parts of the plan and drive back some days after.

- waterproof clothing: the problem for me was not the cold temperature nor the wind, but the rain. it's better to pay a bit more for real waterproof clothes than being wet during an entire hike. We bought waterproof goretex shoes at home (CMP and Columbia) and they were full of water after 10 minutes hike, and it was not even raining that much! Ridiculous! Salomon were a bit better but not a lot. So having a replacement pair for the rest of the day is really important. Consider that everything that's sold in the shops (locals or not) is crazy expensive.  

- tap water is free and good everywhere you go, no need to buy bottled water.

- speed limits are just on paper. I saw just a few tourists following them. locals don't follow them and overtake like in F1 races. 

- just a few puffins left in their main ""locations"" at the end of the month. low chance to see them but not zero. we chased them up to Westman Island, we took the ferry just for them and they did not disappoint us :)",1,2.0
Post,Late september - what can we expect?,__Ecstasy,2024-09-09 11:22:08,"Hi, we are yet another group going on a Ring Road road trip, from September 23rd - 30th.

We've gotten some ideas from research already, but we're very much inexperienced and we wanted to hear from this subreddit what we should expect in terms of:

- any cool **volcanic hikes** we can do?

- **F road closures.**.?

- **wildlife**? - I presume puffins will be gone by then, so we'll be able to see mostly sheep and seals?

- **ice glaciers/caves**? - is it still too early for this?

- and anything we should be aware of specifically for this time of the year, in terms of weather, campsites, driving, etc etc. And anything useful to bring, besides the obvious hiking/road trip gear.",0,7.0
Comment,,misssplunker,2024-09-09 11:37:44,"What do you mean with volcanic hikes? Hikes where you can see lava or magma? There's lava all over Iceland (except the West- and Eastfjords. Currently there's no ongoing eruption and the recent ones have not been tourist eruptions 

Given the weather we're having, I would assume most, if not all, F-roads would be closed or heavily restricted

The sheep are being gathered for réttir, so you're unlikely to see many roaming around. There will be some horses around and depending on where you're going, you might get a glimpse of reindeer, but most of the summer birds will be gone or leaving (incl. puffins)

They might be beginning to open, but it also might be too soon

There's ton of information on here about tips on driving, camping, weather etc. - Many campsites will be closed, so check before you head out, since there might be a long drive to the next open campsite",3,

Post,"See you again, Iceland!",unicorno07,2024-09-07 23:23:04,"We were extremely lucky, as the fresh volcano eruption just happened 1 week before our trip, and ended the day we left. We enjoyed the magnificent view very much!

We also felt we missed a lot, as we constantly need to fight with extreme weather. 3 out of 4 tours got cancelled. The blue ice cave tour got cancelled as it collapsed and killed one tourist right before our trip. The Jökulsárlón zodiac tour was cancelled due to strong wind. Failed to find the trace of puffin thanks to big fog. Got the volcano helicopter tour cancelled twice due to low cloud and visibility. Also I lost my drone, as I tried too hard to take a good recording on the volcano. I hiked the next day trying to find it, but then I stopped when I have lava crust in sight (See the attached image). I know it's a stupid thing, and I probably should not even hike at all, but at least I stopped, not as crazy as that guy, lol.... (I uploaded the cached low res footage from my drone)

Post,Trip Report August 19th - August 27th (long),dolphan013,2024-09-03 19:48:32,"Trip report August 19th - 27th (2nd try, guess I do not know how to post pics)

About us - 

Early 50's, in decent physical shape, we like to hike. We are not foodies and could care less about local cuisine. We brought freeze dried meals, peanut butter and instant coffee. We brought water bottles and drank the tap water.

I also plan way ahead of time and most of the days are planned and filled before we get there. I know a lot of people do not like planning like this but this is who I am and it works for us. I plan out ""must do's"" and ""like to do's"" so that if some or all of the ""like to do's"" are missed I am OK with it.

Having said that, the weather on the second day forced us to change things up a bit and it was a good thing our plan was to backtrack a bit as we were able to pick up some missed items later in the trip.  The plan was to go from Reykjavic to Vik to Hof then back to Hvolsvöllur then up to Geysir then to Keflavik.

Play Airlines -

I used Play Airlines out of Stewart Airport in NY. Check-in was smooth, they made a couple people measure their backpacks in the sizing boxes but it did not seem too strict with bag sizes. The people they had measure were those that looked like they packed their whole trip in their backpack.

Coming back they did not seem to care about bag sizes, there were a ton of people checking in so maybe they did not want to hold things up. Checkin went fast, they had all the booths manned which is rare in my experience.

Trying to sleep on Play flights is almost impossible. I've never been on a flight that only had pay for purchasing of food and no ""free"" service. People were ordering food the whole flight, the lights had to be kept on to facilitate this and the stewards were running back and forth constantly to take orders, cook and deliver food. It was chaos. I guess that is what a bargain airlines is like, it was my first time on an airlines such as this and I was not ready for it.

Parking -

I used Parka (and EasyPark once) for paid parking. I had turned on the Parka autopay feature and it did not work so I think I am going to get a fine or something for not paying at my first site or two as I forgot to check to see if it worked. Parka worked fine for manually paying for parking. At one stop (I cannot remember which one) Parka did not have an option for paying so I tried the EasyPark app and I was able to pay from that app.

Gas -

I used the Orkan tourist card added to my Google wallet to pay. I did not get gas at any other gas station. I filled up two and a half times. Fill up for a Rav4 was about $100 so we spent $250ish for the trip. We did a lot of driving though.

Driving -

I found highway 1 easy and non-stressful to drive. I did not see anything crazy going on with the overtaking (there are decent amount of people going between 70-80 on that road) and there are plentiful areas to overtake. There were a few people stopped on the side of the road but not as many as I thought there would be.

Driving Reykjavic - 

I did not do much of this but I found it a bit confusing as I was expecting STOP signs and did not see a single one. I google ""iceland stop signs"" and was always showed what basically looks like a US stop sign. I just ended up stopping/slowing down at every intersection where it was not obvious what to do.
The roundabouts I had previously researched and knew the inside lane had right of way, once you see others (probably locals) drive these roundabouts a couple times it really makes sense and is easy to adjust to.

Money -

I never say any Icelandic money. I paid with my credit card at most places. Google pay gave me trouble a couple times so I resorted to my wife's Apple Pay (which always worked) or my credit card.

Zero Car rental -

I got to ""Zero"" at about 5:30am, it's actually Blue, I did not even see a sign for Zero although it's on Google Maps. We walked there from the airport, about an 8 minute walk. They key lockbox did not open, I went to the counter (glad there was someone there that early) and they gave me a key. They did not really explain why the box didn't open, he tried telling me that I did not request it then when I showed him my email he shrugged and gave me a key.

When I returned the car she looked up that I had zero liability, smiled and took my key and said have a safe trip. I got two chips in the windshield, the first one happened before I even got to my first accommodations. No idea when the second occurred. Anyway, it was nice to not have had to worry about that.

Weather -

First day nice and sunny. Second day 50mph winds and rainy. The next few days were mostly cloudy and 55F then we had a sunny day followed by a rainy and cold day for the last day. The temps ranged from about 50F to 57F. Did not see much sun at all.

Clothes -

I run a lot warmer than my wife. I wore shorts on three or four of our days here. For my torso I had a shirt, a long sleeve light running shirt, a sweater and my rain/wind proof jacket. When I wore pants I also had wind/rain proof pants for my outer layer there. As everyone says - layers! The wind/rain proof outer layer is a must. I had a beanie for my head (and the hood from my jacket). My wife wore....well, girl stuff, I have no idea but she had layers of stuff that kept her kind of warm, she's cold when it's 65F so she was pretty much always cold. We also had water  resistant socks and hiking boots.

Day 1 -

-Checked into Hotel Reykjavik Grand.

-Hallgrimskirkja and Sun Voyager to kill some time before our ""Inside the Volcano Tour""

-Inside the Volcano tour (Arctic Adventures) - Awesome unique experience. Hiked to a dormant volcano and was lowered inside, we were left to run around in it for about 45 mins and then we left and hiked back out. They had arctic foxes there that they fed, very cute. This tour was VERY expensive but we were happy with what we got, a once in a lifetime experience.

-Bonus on way back to hotel for food

-Was going to explore Reykjavic more but hit a wall and crashed at 5pm

Day 2 - Terrible weather day for where we were headed (Vik). A lot of rain and 50-60mph gusts of wind. We changed things around a bit since we'd be back through this area in a couple days to adjust for the weather. Since we'd be wet we decided to do things that would get us wet anyways.

-Seljalandsfoss/Gljufrabui - amazing! crowded, got wet

-Skógafoss  - also amazing and crowded, originally was going to do about 5 miles of the Fimmvorduhals Trail (10 miles total) but could not because of the wind. got wet.

-Kvernufoss - also amazing, a lot less people, got wet

-Vik - Katla Wool Studio, bought some wool gear, products here seemed a LOT cheaper than the tourist shops, I am not sure if it's because the wool items sold here are not ""as good"" as the other shops or if it's because they are a small family run shop. My wife said the $500 sweaters at the tourist shops seemed thicker than the $150 sweaters we got at Katla but I am no wool sweater expert so I don't know if there really is a difference. I liked the sweaters we got and thought they were fine and it was also neat that they were actually making them in the shop itself.

-Smiðjan Brugghús (one of the few places we ate at), food was OK, beer was good.

-Víkurfjara Black Sand Beach, got wet

-Dyrhólaey Viewpoint, got wet

-Dyrhólaey Lighthouse, got wet

-Reynisfjara viewpoint - lots of puffins!  got wet

-stayed at Gotur cottages (a tiny home)

Day 3 -

-Reynisfjara Beach\Hálsanefshellir Cave

-Gígjagjá (Yoda Cave) - this was better than I expected, we were here early, not many people here.

-Mossy Lava Fields - the actual ""entrance"" to this seemed a little dangerous, even for our 4WD, so I just parked a bit of the way up and we walked around a little bit.

-Fjaðrárgljúfur viewpoint\Mogafoss - we went up the Froad 206 and saved an hour or two hiking by parking pretty much right next to this viewpoint. Did not want to hike because the weather was kinda of crappy again. This viewpoint is really great.

-Systrafoss - a short hike, not busy here

-Kirkjugólf Natural Monument

-Stjórnarfoss - short walk, no one here

-Dverghamrar

-Fossálar Waterfall - spent a bit of time here, it's really nice. Cooked up a couple backpacking meals here

-Diamond beach - west side is better for ""diamonds"". Did not see a lot of them but they were there.

-Jökulsárlón Glacier area - looked around, saw seals

-Svínafellsjökull Glacier - short walk to glacier, hardly anyone here, spectacular.

-stayed at Nonhamar Mini-Cottages (tiny home) for 2 nights

Day 4 -

-Zodiac Boat Tour on Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon (Ice Lagoon) - Loved this tour, they took us up to the glacier and we saw some pieces breaking off. Very informative guide, took lots of pictures.

-Viewpoint over Jökulsárlón

-Diamond Beach - went back because we saw there were tons of gigantic pieces of iceberg all over the beach. They were humongous, big enough for 3-4 people to climb on. What a great experience.

-Glacier hike/climb (Troll) - Really liked this tour, drove a bus to Svínafellsjökull Glacier, hiked in and they let us use ice axes and crampons to climb up the side of a glacier wall 3 times. Another very unique experience that we really enjoyed.

Day 5 -

-Svartifoss\Hundafoss hike, 3 miles I think

-Rauðárfoss

-Katla Wool Studio again to buy more wool stuff

-Víkurfjara Black Sand Beach again so we could see it in sunny weather

-ate at Ströndin • Pub - food was OK

-Kronan for grocery refresh, this place was a zoo, maybe because of nearby campground?

-Sauðafoss - a little ways up a crappy Froad

-Nauthúsagil - down another Froad, this was a cool hike, we only went to first falls, were not in the mood to get our feet soaked again.

-Íráfoss

-stayed at Seljalandsfoss Horizons, super expensive tiny home. picked this only because of proximity to attractions and the fact we were backtracking and I did not want to drive too far in one day.

Day 6 -

-Urriðafoss - well worth a short stop if you are driving by, a fairly angry waterfall and only takes a few minutes to see

-Gulfoss - we got here kind of early, wasn't too busy but still a lot of people. A nice gift shop here.

-Brúará Trail - 4 miles out and back, saw Hlauptungufoss, Miðfoss and Brúarfoss. water here is an incredible blue. This place really stood out for me because of this.

-ate at Efstidalur II, the reviews were really good on this place but I found the burgers meh and the ice cream nothing special. Maybe I just do not know good food.

-Kerid Crater - neat to see, we walked around the bottom and top.

-Geysir - severely underwhelming. Maybe because I've been to Yellowstone? Strokkur Geyser was erupting for like .5 seconds at a time, not even long enough to take a photo. Maybe I just went at a bad time. The gift shop seemed like 20% more expensive than any other gift shop I had been to. I did not spend much time on the golden circle so maybe that is why it was so expensive.

-stayed at Litli Geysir hotel, nice and clean, very simple and cheap. Hung out and had a few drinks, we were winding down by this point with the end of our trip in sight.

Day 7 -

-Þórufoss

-Hvammsvik Nature resort & Hot Springs - had a 10am appointment (the first). Very few people here at the start. We got the package that allowed for the private changing room/showers but it was not policed and anyone could just do what they wanted so I could have saved a few dollars here. My wife said none of the women were showering nude (again, no policing) and I'm only adding that info because I know a lot of people ask about this. They give out bracelets for lockers and to purchase drinks. My wife and I really liked it here. They had various pools of all different temps and you could hop in the ocean for a cold plunge. we tried all the pools (I think) and I also cold plunged, it felt really great. We bought a few drinks here (at about $10 a drink). We finally had a nice sunny day again since the first day we got here and enjoyed ourselves for a couple of hours.

-Drove back to Reykjavic so I could get a tattoo. We explored the Rainbow Road a little bit (my tattoo was right off this road) and was underwhelmed with the touristy shops and the restaurants. We are not big on cities in general and this just reinforced why but we were only here really because I wanted to get a tattoo here otherwise we probably would have found something in nature to do.

-Drove to our hotel in Keflavik with the intent to go back out and grab up some eruption sightings but we ended up having a few too many drinks and decided to check the eruption out in the morning (which ended up being a mistake).

-stayed at Lighthouse Inn, affordable simple hotel.

Day 8 -

-We had a flight at 4pm, had planned on going to a couple touristy spots and checking out the eruption. The weather had turned to crap and the visibility was garbage. We went to 5 different view spots and could see the eruption but not very well. In retrospect we should have went back out the night before because the weather was clear and we saw that people had posted clear pictures of the eruption with the aurora and we missed out on this. I really regretted this decision. Keep in mind if you have clear/sunny skies it probably wont last and don't squander that time sitting in a hotel and drinking =)

-We ended up at the airport way to early for our flight but had run out of things to do with the weather so it was what it was. We had our first hot dogs in Iceland here, wasn't a big fan, they were OK. I think as an American I am just too used to super salty hot dogs and these did not fit that bill. Also as an American, the mustard here isn't ""yellow mustard"" it's more like a honey mustard.

-Flight was on time and we got home a bit early. The boarding process was another new thing for me. We went out to the tarmac on busses and they had two sets of stairs leading up to the plane, one in the front and one in the back. Seemed a bit chaotic to me and I have no idea how they got a woman in a wheelchair in that plane.

Can't wait to go back and explore the North!",16,4.0

The food at gas stations are really good. I'm used to only having the option of nachos, frozen burritos, or other junk foods.

Also not used to paying for public restrooms. Frustrating when I pay to use it and they are out of soap or paper towels. 

I'm also surprised with the lack of top sheets on the beds. I apologize to the hotel staff for taking the comforter out and just sleeping with the liner.

I'm also in my 40s and was the first time showering in a communal shower at the baths.

Post,My full review of my an Iceland solo trip,NoDentureAdventure,2024-08-29 15:51:27,"I just got done with my 4 day solo trip to Iceland and would like to help anyone else who is doing research for their trip. For context, I’m 27 and from the US and visited in August 2024. Some things may interest me more than you and that’s ok. 

**Disclaimer:** some of this will be anti-tourist. I understand that I’m also a tourist. But I feel a lot of tourist destinations involve loud and unaware visitors that I don’t enjoy. 

**Driving:** I rented my car from **Lotus**. They offered the cheapest price for a fully insured vehicle. I would recommend getting all of the insurance as the weather here is wild. Driving is not very difficult here but there are some things I wish I knew ahead of time. Driving in Reykjavík is a headache. It is a car hostile city and pedestrians rule the road (from a US perspective). This is a great feature of the city but made driving somewhat anxiety inducing.  The top speed on the island is 90km/hr (62mph) which feels slow. I would not recommend speeding as fines here are astronomically high. I’d recommend looking up road signs prior to arriving as they are very different than the US

**Housing:** I stayed all 4 nights at the **Loft Hostel**. It’s a great location within the city. There’s a bar and small restaurant on the top floor. This makes it easy to meet new people. It’s a bit noisy at night with the popular street outside and the bar on top and there aren’t a ton of bathrooms. I would probably have booked a private bathroom if I did it again. 

**Prices:** the prices weren’t crazy unless it came to food. Expect $20-30 per meal. There were a few times I got a burger, fries, and a beer and it brought my total to $40. Definitely my biggest expense. I didn’t bring any cash with me and only used my card so don’t worry about exchanging a ton of currency.

**Day 1: Reykjavik**

**Walking tour:** most European cities offer a free walking tour and I wouldn’t skip this one. This was the highlight of the day as our tour guide was wonderful and explained a lot about the history and culture of Iceland. They will ask for tips at the end but I think this is only fair for a free service. 

**Hallgrimskirkja:** it’s the big church and it’s impossible to miss. It’s got cool architecture and pipes. It’s free to visit into until you take the elevator. It’s about $10 (1381IKR) to ride up to the top and see the city from its high point. I personally wasn’t impressed with the view so I would not pay this again. 

**Day 2: Nature/Central and East**

**Silfra Fissure diving:** this is the only spot in the world in which you can swim between two tectonic plates. It’s advertised as a top 5 adventure in the world and I believe it. Genuinely one of the coolest experiences I’ve ever had and would recommend it to everyone. I went snorkeling and it’s about $160 (22.100IKR) and takes probably 2 hours from suit on to suit off. 

**Thingvellir National Park:** this gives a great view of the fissure and the island’s largest lake. Very pretty views. I was hoping for a decent hike but this was probably a 30 minute paved trail with a lot of tourists in the middle stopping to take photos. 

**Strokkur Geyser:** a very underwhelming experience which may be a hot take. It seems to erupt every 5 minutes or so and the water goes to around 30 feet in the air perhaps. This just didn’t interest me and I would probably say it’s worth skipping. Also had a ton of people there being very disruptive which dampened my experience. 

**Brúarfoss:** It’s Iceland’s bluest waterfall and probably 30 minutes worth of time. People get really close to the waterfall which can be dangerous. People have died very recently from doing this. $5 (690IKR) parking. 

**Öxarárfoss:** very cool waterfall with some interesting rocks to look at. There seemed to be some camp sites nearby if that interests you. $7 (1.000IKR) parking

**Þórufoss:** also probably my favorite waterfall. It’s very remote but easy to get to. There wasn’t a single person here and the waterfall is MASSIVE. Highly recommend. 

**Helgufoss:** the highlight of this waterfall would be the horses that are just chilling here. You can walk right up to them and snap a pic. Don’t touch them though. 

**Day 3: Whale Watching/Cultural Night**

**Elding Whale Watching:** a very unique experience that I’m glad I tried. It’s a lot like fishing where nothing happens for a bit and then the action starts. Saw about 6 whales which isn’t a guarantee that you’ll see one. Most of the time they are just coming up for air so don’t expect a huge eruption. It is very cold and windy out there so bundle up. Probably wouldn’t go a second time. It costs about $136 (18.700IKR) and took 3 hours. 

**Cultural Night:** I didn’t want to spend much time in Reykjavik after my first night but once a year the city shuts down many roads for their biggest festival of the year. Lots of live music, art, food, and drinks. It made me really appreciate the city more and all of its people. I also ran in the marathon and all of the locals came out to cheer which was very nice and felt like they had a great community. Might be a result of the festival, but it was impossible to go to a restaurant without a reservation so it may be worth making one if you have a particular place you’d like to eat at during your stay.

**Day 4: South Island**

**Seljalandsfoss:** very popular and large waterfall. The coolest part is that you can walk behind the water. This place gets very very busy but if you go early/late in the day then it’s not too bad. $7 (1.000IKR) parking

**Gljúfrabúi:** in the same parking lot as Seljalandsfoss, this waterfall is between some cliffs. A little harder to get close to unless you want to walk through the water and get soaked.

**Kvernufoss:** one of my favorite waterfalls that is about a 15 minute walk by a small creek. You also get to go behind this one but it’s not as much water. Very few people during my visit

**Skógafoss:** possibly the most famous waterfall and for good reason. This one is massive and gorgeous. If you come on a sunnier day then there’s a pretty rainbow that often appears on the water. There’s also a large staircase you can walk to the top of the waterfall but I didn’t do this because my knees were shot from the day before

**Dyrhólaey:** I didn’t see much chatter about this but happened to drive upon this. It overlooks the black sand beach and Atlantic ocean. Beautiful views. It’s probably 400 feet so be careful if there are high winds. There’s a lighthouse to visit from the outside. I saw my first puffin here as well.

**Reynisfjara Beach:** this is where I really started getting Game of Thrones vibes. The rock formations here just don’t look real and this is a must see. High tourist destination so a lot of people climbing on the rocks. There were about a million puffins here which was cool. Puffins were shitting all over. It may have been the weather, but there are a lot of whales that can be spotted about 100 meters from the shore.

**Vik:** can’t say too much about Vik because I stopped here for food (pizza had cream cheese on it which was surprisingly good) but it seems like a cute town

**Þakgil:** this would be a mandatory stop for me if I were to come again. A beautiful and remote camp site with a 9 mile trail to hike. There is a glacier waterfall that you can swim in even if it is freezing. Truly surreal sights that I hope I never forget. Þakgil is probably my biggest recommendation if you are going to Iceland

**Regrets?** Staying in Reykjavik every night. I would have preferred to have different hotels throughout the island or to have camped. This made going to the eastern and northern parts of the island to be difficult from a time standpoint. Also regret not going to the geothermal pools. Not the lagoons but the pools. The locals love them and they’re also way cheaper than the lagoons

Post,Beware of bringing Iceland weather back,Perenially_behind,2024-08-28 23:07:26,"We spent a wonderful couple of weeks in Iceland recently. The weather didn't always cooperate, but we live in an area that is often foggy and drizzly (though not as windy) so we dressed accordingly and took it in stride

However, it seems that we brought Iceland weather back with us! August is usually the sunny month in western Washington State but the week since we got back has been cool, gray, and wet. 

So check your luggage carefully before returning and make sure that nobody snuck bits of bad weather in. I suspect the stuffed puffin my wife bought for her brother as a thank-you for watching our cat while we were gone. 

He is back home now. I'm not saying that elves are behind this, but if you read about a mysterious cold and drizzly snap in southern Arizona, well, draw your own conclusions. ",52,13.0

I’m not particularly choosy about type of cuisine or the cost, we just don’t want to end up at a chain restaurant or somewhere kitschy that serves puffin and whale to tourists.

For an example of what we’re looking for, we really enjoyed Gott in Westman Islands and felt super comfortable there as a family with a small kiddo.

The majority of the expenses were spent towards hotels (1.3k), car ($500 rental, $430 gas, $65 for a wifi box), activities (blue lagoon $300 for a slightly upgraded entry, $312, lava show $73, museum $65, parking at paid sites $40), necessary clothing bought prior (about $600), and food (around $350).We only ate out like 5 times and saved a lot with included hotel breakfasts and by doing two Bonus grocery runs to make sandwiches otw to destinations. It also helped us save time on busy exploration days! Groceries were $180. We bought a cooler for $35 before the trip! We spent about $300 on miscellaneous things like souvenirs. 


DAY 1 - ARRIVAL & BLUE LAGOON 

We arrived on a rainy day at about 9am from NYC. Picked up our car rental from Icerental4x4. Got a mini SUV in case of weather issues or rough roads ahead. We went to Kökulist bakery and had amazing lox sandwiches and coffees. We headed to the Blue Lagoon, a good activity for a rainy day! It was really helpful because i actually had a left leg cramp for the whole 6 hrs of the flight 😩 caught no sleep) We spent a lot longer here than anticipated and only had time to do a Bónus grocery run- we were going to explore Reykjavík after our hotel check in at Reykjavík Marina but we were honestly way too tired from the jet lag. We decided to squeeze some in tomorrow before heading to Snaefellsnes Peninsula. 

Side note - i picked this hotel because there is a free parking zone 3 blocks away and was easy to find. Be aware of the varied parking zones and prices around downtown if you are driving. 

DAY 2 - REYKAVIK & SNAEFELLSNES 

This day was jam packed and we ended our night by midnight, in part because my Icelandic friend was available to spend the day with us! I should have booked two nights in the capital since I had to drop him back, silly me. I had met him while backpacking in 2018 and was happy to see him again. 

Anyways- we spent the morning in Reykjavík, where we walked to the Harpa Concert Hall and my friend texted to meet him at Hallgrimskirkja, which was perfect! We then went to the Phallological Museum on the way back to the car. (my bf said this was a priority for him on this trip so i had to make this happen since we didnt get to go on Day1 😅) we left Reykjavík at noon. 

Snaefellsnes Peninsula - what a fantastic adventure. We got to Kirkjufellsfossar to view Kirkjufell Mountain at about 3pm. I'm a big GOT buff so this was a must! One of the top things I wanted to do was drive an F road (which you need a 4WD for, i believe some other F roads you need a 4x4), and I read online that the F570 is beautiful to drive-plus you can view the Snaefellsnjokull glacier! And omg, it's like a mini version of the Highlands, according to my friend. There were beautiful red, yellow, green and brown colors in the landscapes. It was also so much fun to drive and spent about an hr since we kept making stops for photos and viewpoints.

We then drove to Djúpalónssandur - it's more like a black pebble beach than a black sand beach. It was ok, I just liked the rock formations. We were here for like an hour because my friend got hyper focused on skipping pebbles over a lake there haha. I was looking for the Lóndrangar View point but ended up at the Malarrif Lighthouse by lovely accident. We did go afterwards! We made some quick stops and got some beautiful sunset photos in Hellnar, Arnarstapi, and at the Budir black church. Wish we had time to catch some seals at Ytri Tunga and to see the Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge, but by the end of Budir it was already 9pm and i still had to drop off my friend in Reykjavík while our hotel was in Borgarnes (Hotel Hamar). Yes, that drop off added 2 hrs to the 2hr drive that night. We got to the hotel at 12:40am 😭 But catching up with an old friend is worth it! He had some great icelandic stories and narration for us. 

Side note - we were so fortunate to see arctic foxes 4 times! My friend said he's never seen so many in a day... Perhaps they are becoming reliant on tourists for food - don't feed them, our food is too salty for their digestive tracts and they will forget how to hunt by the time winter comes and then they will die of starvation... Just saying. 

DAY 3 - GOLDEN CIRCLE

Worst thing that can happen - I woke up with the most painful sore throat ever. I was sneezing and had a runny nose. We were so mad that the person sitting behind us on the plane was severely symptomatic and was not wearing a mask. At least we woke up to some stunning views in Hotel Hamar. 

I tried to be a trooper for the Golden Circle, but I couldn't keep going after Thingvellir National Park and kept having to stop just to breathe. We had also gotten lost trying to look for parking lot 3 so we ended up going to p2 for the Öxarárfoss waterfall and p1 for the fault line to make it easier on me. You only need to pay for parking once by the way! FYI, you can easily spend 1-3hrs here depending on how much you want to do it see in this park. We got lunch at Efstidalur (which was amazing, according to my bf the ice cream was super delicious. I couldn't indulge with a sore throat :/ ) and a Bónus run in Selfoss (we had eaten most of the groceries already during our busy day in Snaefellsnes yesterday lol) before going to the hotel in Vik. We spent the night in Hotel Katla - for some reason our room was super hot so we had to leave a window open all night. Would have loved to use their hot tub to help clear my sinuses but it was full due to a birthday party. 

I had so much planned originally (geysir, gullfoss waterfall, kerid Crater, a dinner reservation at Ingólfsskáli Viking Restaurant, maybe see the Keldur Turf House). What a bummer. 
Side note - I'm thinking if we are ever fortunate enough to add a few days stop over in Iceland, we can do this next time. Through Icelandair, you can add between 1-7 days stop over if you're flying with them to Europe. 

Another side note - make sure you pack enough cold meds! Apparently cold meds aren't really a thing to Icelanders lol. I packed enough for a few days but if my bf had also gotten sick, we would have been screwed. I had packed mucinex, dayquil, nightquil, and some nasal decongestants that were very helpful. 

DAY 4 - JÖKULSÁRLÓN & DIAMOND BEACH 

I really need to sleep in and recover so we ended up doing our morning plans to go to the Reynisfjara beach and Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon later in the trip when I was feeling better. We drove 2hrs straight to Jökulsárlón for our 3hr Blue Cave Tour at 1pm - this was at the top of my to do list given the global warmth melting the glaciers quickly. It was GORGEOUS. We had a pretty boring tour guide that you could barely hear and the ride to and from was a majority of the tour time... We were only in the glacier for maybe a half an hour. Still worth the journey though! Wish our time viewing the glacier from the inside were longer. They lend you crampons for your shoes to walk in the glacier by the way, so no need to buy them. 

Afterwards, we took our time at the lagoon to see the glacier fragments floating down to the ocean and even spotted some seals! We also drove to the other parking lot to see Diamond beach, where those pieces of glaciers end up when the tide pushes then. It's really cool to see on the black sand! By the way, you only have to pay for parking once and you can go to any of their parking lots for the day. No need to walk all the way down to the beach like I saw some people crossing the bridge.

We drove an hr to Hofn to check into Milk Factory. We were suprised by the beautiful mountain views from our hotel room! 
After, we went to Otto Matur & Drykkur for dinner. It's a small, family run restaurant (about twelve tables) They literally live on the second floor. The line was out the door after we were sat down immediately at 7:30p! The atmosphere was marvelous and service was superb. I thought the food was a little salty but my bf loved it. 

DAY 5 - HOFN TO VÍK 

Finally, my cold was clearing up and I was able to hug my bf! Imagine an anniversary trip where you can't be too close cuz of sickness? Sheesh. 
After breakfast, we headed to Stokknes. The winds were BRUTAL and it HURTS when the sand hits your skin! Make sure to be covered from head to toe, even wear sunglasses if it's cloudy. Hold onto those car doors for dear life!!! Last thing you want is for the wind to rip them off cuz it has happened! It was kind of cool to see, but I'm not sure if it ended up being worth the additional drive despite my well traveled friend recommended going. The Viking Village was subpar. It was a long wait at the Viking Cafe to get entry tickets, even though the line was not long. We spent here 1.75hr in Stokknes. 

We stopped at the Svínafellsjökull Glacier tongue on the way to Vík. The shapes were really cool to see! Took us an hr. We made a quick stop at Lómagnúpur to view the rock mountain. Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon about an hour long hike total with beautiful views. Highly recommend it. Our timing was impeccable, we expected rain much earlier but it started to on the way back down to the car. 

Some stops that I would have loved to make were the Viewpoint of Fjallsjökull, Mulagljufur Canyon, Hofskirkja turf house church, and the Svartifoss waterfall at Skatafell national park... But we didnt have time since we had a 7pm lava show reservation back in Vik. It was actually well worth it! We had a great host for the show and was very informative. The lava show itself was impressive but gets super hot! Luckily the rain cleared up be the end of the show at 8pm so we took the opportunity to catch the sunset over Reynisfjara black sand beach. My gosh, what an amazing place to be during the sunset. The rock formations on the east side of the beach are super cool. And we got to see puffins!!! We ended the night with checking into Hotel Kría. 

DAY 6 - VIK TO THE AIRPORT 

Our last day in Iceland! What a bummer, but also a perfect final day in Iceland. We had a flight at 7:50pm so we aimed to drop off the car by 5pm. After breakfast in the hotel, we made a quick stop to Vík i Myrdal Church for a viewpoint over Vik. We then drove about half an hour to Dyrhólaey's lower parking lot for a view of the beach. There is another upper parking lot to drive up to for the Dyrhólaey Lighthouse. Omg, we got to see puffins up close!!! They burrow right on the side of the Dyrhólaey cliffs and they see super cute. We spent more time than anticipated here because of the puffins, lol. We spent 1.5hrs total here in Dyrhólaey and left arround noon. 

Make sure to have your waterproof jacket and pants on. It gets wet at Skógafoss, Seljalandsfoss, and Gljufrabui! We saw a double rainbow in Skógafoss! When you get up to the waterfall, it becomes a rainbow circle... Kind of crazy. We didn't have enough time to go to the upper viewpoint of this waterfall. We drove half an hour to the Seljalandsfoss. Yes we did get to walk behind it and it gets SUPER COLD, oh my goodness. But really awesome. I didn't quite enjoy going into Gljufrabui about a ten min walk away... There are too many tourists trying to get in and out of such a cramped space at once. You'd think people would be smarter and patient about it. We waited for enough people to exit before entering but others after us didn't, so it was hectic. Make sure you wear your waterproof boots in here- you'll be stepping in plenty of water when there aren't enough rocks to stand on. 

Lastly, we headed back to the airport. Got to the rental place by 5:20 but still made it to our flight with plenty of time to get some last minute souvenirs! 


THE END :(

This trip was amazing and wish we had more time and money to see more. Hope my advice, tips, and experience, will be helpful to anyone planning to go! If I were to redo the trip, maybe i would have cut out Hofn in our plans and only gone as far as Jökulsárlón to have less driving time that could have been used to see the sites we missed along the south. But I really wanted to try that restaurant so that part was worth it I guess! What I miss the most in terms of food are actually the grocery sandwiches we made during the trip - their edelbeikon, roast pork, and lamb cold cuts are SUPER GOOD, their butter is SUPERB, and the Icelandic flatbread is DELICIOUS. Their dairy products are definitely superior since all their livestock are actually free roaming. Kinda crazy how you can taste the difference. 

Feel free to ask me questions, I'm more than happy to help. Thank you to the reddit community for having helped me plan this trip too! And thanks to anyone who took the time to read my trip report.",82,24.0

Easy ferry ride from the south coast of Iceland. Plus it’s the season when the pufflings have hatched and are lost and kids (and adults) all over the island trying to find and release pufflings back to sea. It’s amazing.

Post,DETAILED REPORT OF OUR 12 DAYS IN ICELAND,inostrale,2024-08-23 18:20:35,"We just came back from our 12 day trip to Iceland and I thought I'd share our itinerary, expenses, and experience. There aren't going to be any pictures, I don't recommend reading this if you're looking for inspiration, this might just be useful if you're about to embark on a similar journey so you know what you could expect. This is not a guide either, as we actually made a few mistakes.

**DISCLAIMERS**

Feel free to skip this part if you're just interested in what we did, and not why we did it.

**A lot of driving.** 2778 kilometers or 1726 miles to be specific. We hit the ring road (route 1) which allows you to circle the whole island, with several detours. Some of these were worth it, others not so much (in our humble and personal opinion).

Roadtripping is our favourite way of travelling, so it was a no-brainer for us to go this route. If you hate driving, I suggest booking tours from Reykjavik, you can easily hit all the main attractions in Iceland on a tour bus without renting a car. If you like driving, but you don't love it, I think sticking to the ring road without detours is the way to go.

Also note we found driving in Iceland to be very relaxing, even on F roads (dirt roads you are only allowed to drive on with a 4X4 car. We had a Dacia Duster and had no problems whatsover, but also keep in mind we never ventured into the most difficult tracks where you have to cross rivers, among other things).

**We crammed a lot in.** The downside to this is that we never spent more than 2 hours at each attraction (with a couple of exceptions) as we had to be on the move all the time.

The reason for this is that when we visit a new country we try to see as much as possible simply because we will probably never return to it. Not because we don't want to, it's just that the urge to see somewhere new is stronger. We obviously didn't see everything as it would take a lifetime and more, we built our itinerary around a simple rule: we tried to see the most satifying things with as little effort as we could make.

We talked with several fellow travelers along the way who had an entirely different approach: they skipped a lot of attractions and spent at least half a day at each place they visited. While in hindsight I'm happy with the way our itinerary turned out, I also admit some places we visited definitely deserved more time to take it all in.

**We traveled frugally.** I will break down the costs in the next section, but let me preface it by saying that we had a somewhat tight budget, and this affected all of our expenses, in particular food. I'm not ashamed to say we ate a lot of sandwiches (pre-made at the shop or buying smoked salmon and bread), hot dogs, canned tuna. Yes, you heard that right. We ate out 5 times in total (I'll go into details later).

I'm going to be honest, while we don't regret what we did, towards the end of the trip we started to feel that our bodies needed more variety in our diets, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. As for me, if I could go back, I would just make sure to bring a couple of vitamin supplements with us. Bonus was obviously our preferred grocery store to go to.

**COSTS**

Before even setting foot in Iceland, my partner and I had already spent 1795€ each.  
This amount included the following:

* Flight ticket to and from Keflavik (closest international airport to Reykjavik) with one piece of hand-on baggage and one piece of checked luggage (maximum weight: 20 kilos) included. Airline: PLAY Airlines. We flew from continental Europe.
* Parking for 12 days at the parking lot near the airport where we left our car for the trip.
* Travel insurance in case we canceled our trip (86€ each).
* Bus tickets from Keflavik to Reykjavik on the day of arrival and from Reykjavik to the Airport on the return date (61€ each). We chose Flybus, which is the go to company for airport transfers.
* Car rental for 10 full days (680€ total, 340€ each).
* Accomodation. This was obviously the most onerous expense. A couple of notes:

1. When we booked the hotels in January, we noticed there was a steep price to pay to go from a single room at a guesthouse with a shared bathroom, to a single room at a guesthouse with a private bathroom. The average mark-up for the private bathroom was about 90€ at each place, I'm not kidding. For this reason we opted for a shared-bathroom, private-room solution for almost every night.
2. We spent on average 130€ per night. Notice that this cost was split in half between me and my partner. If you're solo traveling accomodation is going to be particularly pricey, but you can keep your expenses lower by booking at hostels. We ourselves were tempted to do this, but in the end we chose to spend a little more for intimacy.

Once in Iceland, I personally spent 637€ over the course of 12 days. Cash is pretty much non-existent in Iceland, so it was very easy to calculate the final amount looking at my debit card transactions. This includes:

* Eating out 5 times.
* A lot of grocery shopping (see the frugality notice above).
* Whale-watching tour (60-70€ each, I'll explain more later).
* Fuel (split between my partner and I).
* Souvenirs (60€, only small items as I had limited space in my baggage).
* Parking at tourist attractions. If you didn't know, in Iceland you don't pay to see natural wonders, you pay for a parking spot near them. I highly reccomend installing the Parka app, it makes paying parking fees very easy, but also notice there's a few places where you cannot use this app. I think the price for parking was extremely low for what you get in return, but if you visit a lot of places as we did, this cost adds up quickly.

**Total cost: 2432€.**

**ITINERARY**

**Day 1**

We arrived at Reykjavik late at night, meaning we did no exploration on the first day. I'm still including it as it took a long time for us to get from our home to the hotel, so I would say it was definitely part of the trip. If you're curious, here's the detailed journey:

* Our home --> Parking lot near the airport by car
* Parking lot near the airport --> airport itself by shuttle
* Airport --> plane terminal by bus
* Plane terminal --> Keflavik airport terminal by plane
* Keflavik airport terminal --> Keflavik airport entrance by bus
* Keflavik airport entrance --> Reykjavik downtown by Flybus
* Reykjavik downtown --> our hotel by Flybus shuttle

This might sound like we wasted a day and could have landed directly in the morning, but we decided to get to Reykjavik at night on purpose, so we could get 8 hours' sleep and wake up in the morning full of energies and ready for the adventure ahead.

**Day 2**

We spent the morning exploring Reykjavik. It's a small capital, and if I'm going to be honest, it's skippable if you don't have a lot of days for your trip to Iceland. The highlight here obviously is the gothic church and its pipe organ inside (the metal design of which clashes with the architecture of the church). I also heard the Lava Show is very good.

We had decided to spend half a day visiting Reykjavik, and in the afternoon, after taking our rental car, go to either the Blue Lagoon or the Sky Lagoon, but it was a sunny day, and the simplicity of Reykjavik, its laid-back vibe, filled us with so much serenity we parked our rental car next to the hotel and just wandered around town.

This is one of two changes of schedule over the course of our trip, and while we don't regret spending more time in Reykjavik, this decision in particular came back to bite us in the ass on our last day, as I'll explain later.

**Day 3**

We hit the road early in the morning on our way to the **Golden Circle**. This area is a short drive from Reykjavik and due to its proximity to the capital, and the short distance between its famous attractions, is possibly one of the busiest areas of the country. If you include it to your itinerary, I think you can use it as a gauge to evaluate how many tourists you will find on the rest of your trip: it's unlikely you'll find as many people as in the Golden Circle. Note that all the places we visited along the Golden Circle are within 5 minute walking distance from the parking lot.

Our first stop was **Þingvellir National Park**. You have to pay for parking, and you cannot use the Parka app.  
The park has good infrastructure, with a lot of parking space, facilities, and a marked circuit to follow. We spent a couple of hours there. We also visited the waterfall, which we found stunning right then, but in hindsight, it was the least impressive waterfall we saw. We don't regret visiting the park, but to be blunt, while the idea of walking in between two tectonic plates sounds amazing conceptually, aesthetically it was put to shame by the size and scale of what we saw later on.

Then we moved on to **Brúarárfoss**. This was a mere 30 minute stop for us, but totally worth it. A lot of waterfalls in Iceland impressed us for their sheer power, but this one is more delicate, elegant, and obviously the allure lies in the bright light blue color of its waters. Paid parking (Parka).

Next, we went to **Strokkur Geyser**. The busiest area of all. Surprisingly free parking. We spent approximately one hour looking at the geysers and the sulfate minerals in the area. What can I say, for us, as we had never seen an erupting geyser before, it was totally awe-inspiring. I've watched videos of Yellowstone, and if you've been there, probably Stokkur is going to be a little underwhelming in comparison.

Only a 10 minute drive is **Gullfoss**. Again, free parking, we spent about 40 minutes in this area. This is one of those places (and there are many of them in Iceland) the grandeur of which cannot be captured by pictures. While it wasn't raining (yet it was a cloudy day) we had to put our raincoats on as the spray of the waterfall can get you soaking wet in a couple of minutes.

Our last stop was **Kerið**. This is a privately owned property, and the owner allows visitors to see the volcano crater for a fee (you cannot use Parka here). While we saw bigger volcano craters in the following days, this one remains a highlight of Iceland for me. Reason being you can hike all around the crater rim, and also, you can descend to get a view of the lake in the middle and see the crater from below. We spent about 1 hour there.

Then we drove all the way south of Selfoss (a small town) where he spent the night at a guesthouse in the middle of nowhere.

We were tired, but so overstimulated from all the sights we had admired that day, that we couldn't sleep, so we hopped on our car after dinner and went to **Knarrarós Lighthouse**.

The lighthouse itself was closed, but we hiked further on to the shore where we saw the ocean waves washing against a patch of natural rock pools. There was no one in sight. While I don't particularly recommend going to this place, if you have some extra time to spare, I do suggest venturing into some lesser known places where you're less likely to encounter a lot of people at least once.

We came to Iceland for the big natural wonders, and they were totally worth it, but we found the unnamed secluded landscapes and the rare sights of sun to be just as beautiful.

**DAY 4**

We woke up early, earlier than we had wished for, but our hearts were racing and our feet were restless.

We started the day with a detour: **Haifoss**. This was more than an hour's drive from our guesthouse, and even more from our next scheduled destination.

Maybe it was the partially clear sky with fat grey clouds coloring the crestlines in the landscape different hues, maybe it was the land around us starting to look less like Earth, and more like Mars, maybe it was because it was so early we didn't meet anyone along the road, in any case this was possibly the most atmospheric drive of our drip.

Admittedly, we only spent about 20 minutes at the waterfalls. Other than us, only 2 more people were there. We noticed there was a hike that supposedly led at the feet of the waterfalls, but we didn't have enough time for that. We drove back to the coast on a different route, an F road, the rockiest and shakiest of our trip. We drove past the left turn that would have taken us to Landmannalaugar. We knew it was hard to get to, and as I said earlier, our intenton was to see most of the island making as little effort as possible, so we skipped it entirely. Still, we got a little taste of the otherworthly landscape you can expect to encounter in that area by just driving south back to route 1. Free parking for Haifoss.

It started to rain as we reached **Seljalandsfoss**. This was the most ""Instagram vs reality"" moment of our trip.  
It was a lot more packed than social media would have you believe, and we had to wait in a car line as the parking lot was full. The main allure of the waterfall is the fact that you can walk behind it. Now, I never complain about huge crowds when I travel simply because I'm well aware I'm part of that crowd, but when you cannot take a single step without anyone giving you annoyed looks because you got in the way of their perfect picture, that's when the crowd kind of ruins the experience for me.  
A short walk from Seljalandsfoss takes you to neighbooring Gljufrabui, a very picturesque waterfall because it is inside a cove. As we made our way there, we realized there was a queue to get into the cove, so we just decided to skip it. Overall, we spent about 1 hour in this area. Paid parking (Parka).

We checked in at our guesthouse west of Vik, and then drove to **Reynisfjara**. I will say this is one of the few places in Iceland that wears its best dress when it's cloudy (and rainy, in our case): the dramatic towering black rocks emerging from the ocean, the pitch black sand, the cove covered in basalt columns, it all stands out more on a grey day, giving off ominous and eerie vibes. Even with the huge crowds, it was the highlight of the day for me. Also hundreds and hundreds and puffins filled the sky, on their way to and from the ocean and their nests on the cliffs. Overall, we spent about 30 minutes at the black beach. Paid parking (Parka).

We then started our way back and stopped at **Dyrhólaey**. We came to this place for the arched cliff in the ocean, we stayed for the views of the endless black beach and puffins almost within arms' reach. We spent around 1 hour taking it all in. Free parking.

Our last stop of the day was **Sólheimajökulll**, a 15 minute detour from route 1. From the parking lot (you can pay with Parka) it's about a 15 minute walk to the beginning of the glacier. While we had no intention of hiking into the glacier, we had neglected to consider the cold: we thought our warm clothing an raincoats were enough if we just stood in front of the glacier, but after a couple of minutes our body temperature was starting to drop so we made our way back.

Because it had been such a rainy day, we treated ourselves to our first proper Icelandic dinner: cod fillet with baked vegetables in butter. Best cod I've ever had.

**DAY 5**

We had 4 stops planned for the day, and rain accompained us along 3 of them until the middle of the afteroon.

The highlight of the day though was the ever-changing landscape: when we started our drive, it was all green cliffsides, then it became immense expanses of black rocks covered in moss, then at one point it was like we were driving on asphalt road but everywhere around us off the road was also flat and covered in asphalt, then it became endless stretches of tundra.

**Skógafoss**. We hiked all the way to the top of the waterfall. It's an easy 10 minutes hike, with stairs. The main reasons why we included it to our itinerary was that it is a filming location of Game of Thrones, and it's ridiculously close to route 1. We spent about 30 minutes there. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Would I still have visited it if it hadn't been so close to the main road? I'm not sure. Free parking.

**Fjaðrárgljúfur**. Absolutely breathtaking. The hike to the end of the trail is easy and takes about 20 minutes. It's another of those places that pictures don't do it justice. Spent 1 hour exploring every single angle of the canyon from above. Paid parking (Parka).

**Svartifoss**. Very scenic waterfall. We're into hiking, so we loved the 40 minutes hike to reach it. If I could go back, I personally would do it again, but I'm going to be honest: if you're also visiting Stuðlagil Canyon, at the beginning of the trail leading to it is a waterfall with a similar configuration as this one. Spent about 1 hour and a half here (hike included). Paid parking (Parka).

**Diamond Beach & Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon**. You can and should tackle those two together. It's touristy, but for me it's still one of the best places in Iceland. The glacier lagoon more so than the beach. By this time of the day the sky had cleared so we could see the ice glittering in the sunlight. We spent about 2 hours at this place. Paid parking (Parka).

Then we checked in at our Guesthouse in Höfn. Because of the vivid orange sunset we were lucky enough to encounter as we walked around town and its park by the lighthouse, I will never forget about this small town.

**DAY 6**

We began the day at **Stokksnes**. This is a privately owned area famous among photographers: you can get a spectacular view of an endless black beach with a towering mountain the background. To access the area you have to buy a ticket from a bar by the entrance called the Viking Cafe. If you walk by the cliffs you have very good chances of spotting sea lions. It was our first time seeing one and there was a very kind girl next to us who noticed our excitement so she offered to lend us her binoculars to get a better view. If you go to Iceland, bring binoculars! We regret not bringing ours! Also we saw a wild mink. Spent 1.5 hours here.

We then drove on route 1 along the eastern fjords, the views were incredible. Our next stop was Hengifoss so we took a shortcut to an F road to skip a good chunk of route 1. The landscape changed once again... and it was like we were back somewhere in Europe with birch trees and fir trees dotting the land.

**Hengifoss** was spectacular. It's a 40 minute hike from the parking lot, mostly uphill- The good thing is that you can spot the tip of the waterwall from the parking lot and it becomes closer and closer as you make your way up. I was just slightly disappointed to discover that you can't get a little closer to the waterfall. The rock formations leading to the waterwall were also amazing, it looked like gigantic instant coffee chunks. Spent about 1.5 hours here. Paid parking (Parka).

Then we went north of Egilsstaðir to check in at our guesthouse. After dropping our bags, we made two trips before calling it a day:

**Seyðisfjarðarkirkja**. Pretty little village nestled between the mountains. I felt like I was in Norway. We were somewhat hungry, and we decided to eat at a restaurant. While the food was good and the prices in line with what you'd expect in Iceland, I'll admit I felt as though I had fallen for a tourist trap for the first time during our trip. But I only have myself to blame as I had a burger with fries.

**Borgarfjörður eystri**. It took us in total 1.5 hours' driving from Egilsstaðir to Borgarfjörður eystri and then from Borgarfjörður eystri back to our guesthouse. This place is famous as it's the spot for bird-watching in mainland Iceland, especially puffins. Only they had all already migrated. All we saw was the holes they dig as nests. Obviously if I had known, I wouldn't have bothered to drive all the way there. On the way back though, my partner was able to spot an artic fox. By the time I pulled over (there was no one behind me) and turned my head, it had already disappeared amid the bushes.

**DAY 7**

We drove to **Stuðlagil Canyon**. it's about a 20-30 minutes detour from route 1. The road is not paved, but it's an easy drive even without a 4x4 car.

You can access the canyon from the east and the west. On the west parking is free, and you can walk down a flight of stairs to see the canyon from above. Honestly it was underwhelming. If we could go back, we would skip the western side entirely.

Then we went to the east side. We had heard all kind of stories about how hard it is to get to lower parts of the canyon from the parking lot. It was actually an extremely easy, albeit moderately long hike. Took us about 50 minutes each way. It's all straight, no climbs. At the very hand, you can venture down into the canyon by climbing down the basalt columns on its edges. We were lucky enough to witness pristine blue water on that day. It appears the water can also be muddy on some days, making it brown. One of the highlights of our trip for sure. We spent about 3 hours here. Paid parking (Parka).

As we got into our car and started our way north, the weather changed drastically. It started to rain, but the real problem was the wind, so cold and sharp that it felt like blades.

We received an email from our whale-watching tour company in Husavik cancelling our booking due to unstable weather conditions. We had booked a rib boat tour, which we figured is more prone to harsh ocean conditions. We booked an oak boat tour with another company and we made our way to our next stop: Ásbyrgi.

When we got to **Ásbyrgi**, we couldn't find the parking lot, and I admit we had been naive in that we hadn't done a lot of research into how to access this place. But I will also say that as we drove right into the canyon where the forest is, we came across several cars pulled over with people inside them looking as confused as we were. And that's when we received an email from the oak boat tour company, who were also cancelling our booking due to harsh weather forecast. We were tired, dazed by the chilling wind, upset by the tour cancellations, so we just decided to call it quits and made our way to our guesthouse in Husavik early in the afternoon. I'll abstain from saying anything about Ásbyrgi. We've done a fair bit of traveling, it's not the first time we're tempted to push forward when we're not really in the mood for it, and in our experience it was never a good idea. We had dinner early in Husavik at a restaurant (I had the best catfish of my life) and then we had the most restorative sleep of our trip. It was high time we slowed down the pace for half a day.

**DAY 8**

This was the most intense day of our trip. We had so many things planned that we made a drastic decision: we wouldn't visit Dettifoss. We know's it's one of the highlights of Iceland, but after all the waterwalls we had seen, we wanted to spend more time on different things.

We hit the **Diamond Circle**: an area surrounding lake Mývatn where a lot of attractions are close to one another.

**Hverfjall**. This was possibly my favourite place in all of Iceland. It really felt like walking on another planet. It takes about 15 minutes uphill to get to the crater rim, you cannot go down to the center, but you can hike around it. We spent about 2 hours there, but only because we were so engrossed by it. Paid parking (Parka).

**Námafjall**. I don't think it can get any more extraterrestrial than this. A geothermal area where you can see black boiling water, red and yellow soil, natural chimneys. Unlike anything we've ever seen. And it snowed while we were visiting. This is a privately owned place, you have to pay at the parking meter. Spent about 1 hour here, would have spent more if not for the unbearable weather.

**Viti Crater**. By the time we got here, it was just not pleasant to be outside anymore. But because this crater was right in front of the parking lot, we left the comfort of our car, braved the cold, and took a look at the crater. Unfortunately I wish I had spent more time admiring the light blue hues of its lake, but after literally one minute we ran back inside.  Spent 5 minutes here, 4 of which contemplating whether to get out or not. Free parking.

**Namaskardh**. When we got here (very short drive from the crater), it had stopped snowing and it was raining instead. This is a long hike that takes you through the mountains but you can start seeing the geothermal formations well before you start climbing. It was still extremely cold, so after a 30 minute hike as we had already had a glimpse, we turned around and decided to go have lunch. Spent 1 hour here. Free parking.

After a delicious late lunch (we had lamb soup) we went to **Dimmuborgir lava formations**. It was still cold, but it had stopped raining. While this place is not as instantly eye-catching as the others we had seen that day, it was so pleasant to hike among the odd lava shapes we spent more time here than we had anticipated. Spent about 1.5 hours here. Free parking.

**Skútustaðagígar**. This was such a strange place to visit, a lot of bird activity going on. It's a blend of greenery, lake waters and tiny black volcanoes. By this time it was sunny, so we spent about 2 hours walking around this place. Free parking.

We then returned to Husavik as we had 2 nights booked there.

**DAY 9**

After both our whale-watching tours had been cancelled, we tried our luck by booking a last-minute tour in Hauganes. This is the second of two changes of schedules I was talking about earlier on.

The whole day was now centered around the tour, which took place in the early afteroon, so we actually had quite some time to kill.

We visited **Goðafoss**. I'm going to be honest: if it hadn't been such a convenient stop along route 1, and if we hadn't had so much time before the tour, we would have skipped it. I was surprised to see such a huge crowd in the morning at this attraction. The waterfall is beautiful, but we didn't find it as quaint as all the other waterwalls we had seen. Free parking. Spent about 1 hour here.

**Akureyri**. The capital of the North, 4th largest city in Iceland. Again, I'm going to be brutally honest: rainbow walksides, trash bins dressed in gnome costumes, a washing machine out in the open with a sign reading ""Free brainwashing"", it was probably supposed to look characteristic and extravagant to tourists, but the feeling I got strolling around Akureyri was that it was desperate to draw in for a stop all the tourists driving past it along route 1, on their way to or from some much cooler places. There is so much to do and see in Iceland that competition for tourist time and money is fierce, and I got the idea Akureyri is lagging behind in the race.

**Hauganes whale-watching tour**. The reason why we tried our luck and paid in advance for this tour, is that while Husavik is located in a bay, basically exposed to the ocean, Hauganes is nestled in a fjord, so we thought it was partially protected from the bad weather on such a windy day. We still held our breath until the very last minute. Luckily for us, the tour did take place. It lastes 2.5 hours. Quite early in the tour, the captain pointed at a milke whale and then a sperm whale, but I wasn't able to spot either. But we did see several humpbacks. While not my first time seeing whales, I had never seen so close before. The tour was more challenging than I thought it would be though: I didn't get seasick, but I had to pay constant attention to the ocean and the swaying of the waves.

**Hvítserkur**. Quite a detour from route 1 (about 30 minutes farther north) on an F road, this is another highlight for me, simply because we got there quite late in the afternoon, and we were the only two people there, so we got the whole view for ourselves. Spent about 30 minutes here. Free parking.

We spent the night at a guesthouse south of Hvammstangi, right in front of route 1.

**DAY 10**

The only fully sunny day since our second day in Reykjavik. We took the 2.5 hour drive separating us from our first stop of the day.

**Kirkjufell Mountain**. Another popular Game of Thrones filming location. We expected to find a lot more people there. You can hike along a path takes you farther and farther from the mountain (so you can see its shape from different perspectives) and you can hike up to the mountain. We did both, although we didn't climb all the way to the top (I'm not even sure you can do that). Spent about 2 hours here. Paid parking (No parka).

**Stone Bridge**. We drove all the way to Arnarstapi to see its rock formations along the coast. We spent about 1.5 hours hiking along the cliff ridge. But to be honest, if it hadn't been such a nice day, we wouldn't have spent so much time there.

**Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge**. I didn't expect to like this place as much as I did. We hiked all the way to the entrance of the gorge, which takes about 15 minutes, and then as there was a queue to continue the hike on the rocks in the stream we just made our way back. Time spent: 40 minutes. Free parking.

**Búðakirkja**. We only stopped because it was such a short detour, but we weren't particularly impressed. I suppose it becomes very scenic in winter, when the white snow clashes with its black walls. Spent 10 minutes, free parking.

**Ytri Tunga**. This beach is famous for the sea lions living there. We had already seen seals on 3 different occasions by then, but this was the closest we had ever seen them. If you live in a country where seals are a common animal, this spot is absolutely skippable, but for us it was one of the highlights of the day. Spent 1.5 hours there. Paid parking (No parka).

We then drove back north to Stykkishólmur to spend the night.

**DAY 11**

We had done so much the day before we felt like sleeping in on this day. We had planned to visit Fagradalsfjall Volcano before returning to Reykjavik, but by the time we hit the road we realized it would have been possible, but a race against time. Not to mention, it seemed to us the road to the volcano was closed. So we just went back to Reykjavik, checked in at our guesthouse where we dropped our bags, went to return our rental car in the early afternoon... And this is pretty much how the trips ends.

As I mentioned in day 2, we changed our plans. We were supposed to visit Reykjavik in the morning, go to the Sky or Blue Lagoon in the afternoon, and visit Reykjavik more in the afternoon of day 11. When we made that decision, we thought we would go to either Lagoon on day 11 instead, but now it was day 11 and it was very windy and gloomy outside, so we pussied out of it. And because we had already seen everything we wanted to see in Reykjavik, we didn't feel like going outside either. We spent the remainder of day 11 watching movies.

**DAY 12**

Quick trip downtown to buy souvenirs, then we walked to the bus station for the airport transfer at 11:00 am and flew back home.

Happy travels!",47,31.0

Post,Write-up of our 6-night trip Aug 10-16,BelowReplacementLvl,2024-08-23 13:53:57,"My family (me, my wife, and two kids aged 11 and 14) recently got back from our amazing 6-night trip from August 10-16 and since this sub helped me so much with planning, I thought I’d share our experiences to help future travelers!

**~Day 1~**

* Landed at Keflavík at 8:30am.  Customs and baggage pickup was relatively quick, but it took us a while to get the rental car shuttle and there was a half hour wait in line to pick up the car.  We rented a 2WD and declined the insurance because our Visa card covers damages.  Then we stopped off at the local Krónan and got some skyr and pre-made sandwiches to eat at our first destination.  It was about 10:40am when we actually drove out of the airport area.
* First stop was the **Hafnarberg - Sea-cliffs**.  Google Maps tried to take us on an F-road to get as close as possible so my suggestion is to map “Hafnaberg - Sea-cliffs ~parking~” to get to the parking lot.  From there, there is a 1.5-mile hike through some pretty heavy sand to get to the cliffs, but the walk is pretty and the cliffs are breath-taking!  We picnicked on the rocks and watched the waves crash and the birds fly.  I saw a few puffins flying, but they were very low and I couldn’t get a picture of them (I took my fancy zoom lens camera to get some good bird shots).  We were lucky to have a clear day and this was a perfect introduction to the beauty of Iceland!
* Next we drove to Reykjavík to check out the Pride celebration, but by the time we got up there we were all getting tired so we decided to drive to the hotel for a nap.  We stayed at **Bakki Apartments & Hostel** in Eyrarbakki which was reasonably priced and perfect for our needs.  There was a cool view of the ocean right outside the front door.
* After a nap we had dinner at the **Old Dairy Food Hall** in Selfoss and ice cream next door at **Groovis**.  Then back to the hotel to sleep.

**~Day 2~**

* Ate breakfast at the hotel (skyr and fruit bought from Krónan the day before - we stopped by Krónan or gas station convenience stores every day to pick up small bites) and drove up to the Snæfellsnes peninsula.
* Ate lunch at **Hótel Snæfellsnes**.  Food was good and the service was quick.
* Drove to the **Gerðuberg Cliffs**.  We enjoyed walking to the top, building cairns, taking in the views, and then on our way back down to the car, my wife and kids enjoyed climbing up to touch the base of the basalt cliffs.
* Next stop was **Ytri Tunga** beach.  It was starting to drizzle at this point, but we spent quite a while watching several seals lounging around and an arctic tern diving for fish.
* Then it was on to **Bjarnarfoss**.  This was the first of many waterfalls on the trip and it was gorgeous!  It was steadily raining now so we used silicone shoe covers to try to keep our shoes dry.  The covers worked for me, but my wife’s and son’s ripped by the end of the short climb up the hill.  This became a familiar refrain on our trip: a beautiful waterfall with a somewhat steep hike up the side which reveals even more amazing views if you can stomach being mere feet away from falling to your death.  This was my younger son’s favorite waterfall because he liked the (somewhat nerve-wracking for me watching) scramble up the slippery mud and grass.
* At this point we were tired and couldn’t go any deeper into the peninsula.  Snæfellsnes is awesome, but to get the full experience you need to find accommodations closer.  We had to pick up some towels so we stopped at the IKEA in Reykjavík and had a quick hot dog dinner.  Then back to Eyrarbakki to sleep.

**~Day 3~**

* After our usual skyr/fruit breakfast, we checked out of the hotel and drove to **Seljalandsfoss**.  I wore my shoe covers and we put on waterproof pants that went over our regular pants.  This was a good call because it was windy and we would have been soaked otherwise when we walked behind the falls.  This was awesome and highly worth it, but surprisingly the highlight of this stop for us was **Gljúfrabúi** which was just down the path.  The hidden waterfall was a fun mini-adventure as we carefully stepped across rocks into the magical cave.
* Next we drove to **Skógafoss**.  We ate Krónan sandwiches in the parking lot and then hiked up the stairs and followed the waterfall way path for a mile or so.  This was a five-star experience and a highlight of the trip.
* Then we drove to Dyrhólaey, but noticed a cave to the left as we pulled off on Road 218 (I later learned this was called **Loftsalahellir Cave**).  We stopped to check it out and this became one of our favorite surprises.  It was a steep climb up another muddy hill, but it was a unique experience standing in this wide cave that frames a cool view of Dyrhólaey.
* By the time we got to **Dyrhólaey** it was raining, but the puffins were out!  I was ready to pay to do the Ingólfshöfði Nature Reserve the next day to make sure I saw puffins, but I was glad we didn’t have to because we saw so many!  While my wife and kids were exploring the views of the beach, ocean, and rock formations, I planted myself at the edge (carefully - this is a little scary) and snapped hundreds of pictures of the puffins lounging and flying.  This was a dream come true and I could have stayed an hour longer!
* Next of course was **Reynisfjara Beach**.  A picture of this black sand beach was one of the reasons we chose Iceland for a vacation and it did not disappoint.  We loved the sand and cool rock formations.
* Finally we had dinner at the **Black Crust Pizzeria** and drove to our cozy Airbnb cabin in Kirkjubæjarklaustur which sat on a small, beautiful, peaceful lake.  This was a perfect day!  The drive between Eyrarbakki and Kirkjubæjarklaustur was our favorite (perhaps tied with driving around Snæfellsnes)

**~DAY 4~**

* First stop was **Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon**.  This was another inclined hike following a river which we did for about a mile.  We could have gone further because this was, along with the Skógafoss waterfall way hike, the most beautiful thing that we did in Iceland, but we had other stops to make!
* We had a sandwich lunch at a lone picnic table near **Kálfafell**.  We didn’t do the hike, just admired the views.
* Then we drove to **Vatnajökull National Park** and hiked to **Svartifoss**.  This was the longest hike of our trip, but it was well worth it.  We hiked the S2 trail with a brief detour up to the Sjónarsker viewpoint which offered 360° views of the entire area.  All of the waterfalls were great and this was the hike that reminded me the most of the forested hikes in the U.S.
* Next we drove to **Diamond Beach**.  The views on the drive between Svartifoss and Diamond Beach were still good,but it was not my favorite because the mountains were further distant and the land was mostly flat and empty.  But the beach was great.  The air smelled amazingly crisp getting out of the car and we spent a long time walking the beach and watching the waves crash into the icebergs.  We also loved walking back to Jökulsárlón to see the larger icebergs floating in the lake.  Spotting these icebergs for the first time was another one of those “I’ve never seen anything like this!” moments added to the list of Gljúfrabúi, waterfall way, the puffins, Reynisfjara, and Fjaðrárgljúfur).
* On the way back to Kirkjubæjarklaustur we made a quick stop at **Fjallsárlón** and walked the path to see a view of the glacier.  We watched the boat tours crossing the lake, but we were spent at this point so we ate dinner at **Systrakaffi**, returned to our Airbnb and ended the day with a walk around the tiny lake behind the cabin.  Another perfect (but tiring) day!  The weather was very cooperative!

**~DAY 5~**

* This was the day with the most driving and the worst weather (cold, windy, and rainy).  We stopped at **Dyrhólaey** one more time and I got a few last puffin pics.
* Then we hopped on the Golden Circle.  We skipped Kerid Crater and went straight for **Gullfoss**.  We ate sandwiches in our car because of the rain and then walked down to view the falls.  As expected, this was the most crowded stop on the trip, but I’m glad we went because the falls were another “wow” moment.
* Next we skipped the geyser although we actually saw it erupt from the car.  We’re not really geyser people.
* We went to **Þingvellir National Park** and walked in the fissure between the tectonic plates.  We meant to stop by the Bridge Across Continents, but didn’t get a chance so this was a cool experience and history lesson, especially for my son who just took an earth science class.  Before leaving we did the short hike to **Öxarárfoss** which was neat, but we got a little soaked because of the heavier rain.
* We drove a little out of the way to have a reasonably priced dinner at **Galito** in Akranes which was quite pleasant.  I found all of the restaurants that we ate at to be quick, friendly, and tasty.
* We ended the day at **Hvammsvik Hot Springs**.  We knew that we wanted some type of hot springs experience that was more quiet and less touristy than the Blue Lagoon and when I saw pictures of Hvammsvik, I was sold!  The springs consist of six naturally heated pools of differing temperatures overlooking a peaceful fjord.  We reserved the cheapest package which cost us about $50 per person, but my sons and I were upgraded to the premium locker room for some reason when we arrived.  This meant that my nervous kids had a private changing room and shower stall as the rules clearly stipulate a full shower sans bathing suit is required for all admittees.  My wife was stuck with the lesser changing room so she had to shower in the open (I did this by choice because I didn’t feel like waiting for an open stall and honestly, it was fine - no one’s looking and it was rather liberating).  We spent about two hours (6:30-8:30pm) lounging the pools, but did not partake in the cafe offerings or the swim up bar.  Amazingly the rain stopped while we were showering and I can’t explain the relaxing feeling of soaking in the natural hot springs surrounded by such quiet beauty.
* We drove to our final accommodation, **Hotel Hjardarbol** in Selfoss.  Our room was small, but had everything we needed.  Check-in was very friendly and easy.

**~DAY 6~**

* We had the hotel breakfast which was more expensive than our usual Krónan, but was a lovely all-you-can-eat spread.
* We decided to risk driving to **Gjáin** valley even though I was worried about getting there with our 2WD car.  It turns out that the only part of the drive that was hairy was the last 6km or so, but those last 6km were pretty stress-inducing.  Once we turned off Road 32 onto Road 327, the road was not only not paved, but filled with huge rocks, giant puddles, one steep incline, and was ~extremely~ rumbly.  I drove about 10km/hr and was pretty sure I was going to damage our car so I would not really recommend doing this without a 4WD.  We parked at Stöng, walked up to see the longhouse, and then followed the well-marked trail to Gjáin.  Despite the rainy weather, this walk was awesome, not crowded, perfect in length, and filled with lush greenery and more hidden waterfalls.  It felt special seeing something that a lot of people don’t get to experience.
* Now that it was raining pretty hard, we went to the **Perlan** museum in Reykjavík.  We did the northern lights show in the planetarium, walked through the ice cave, and watched the lava show.  This was nice, but certainly not as cool as all of the outdoor experiences we just had.  Good for a rainy day.
* Finally we had burgers at **Hamborgarabúlla Tómasar** by the harbor, gelato at **Gaeta Gelato**, and then back to the hotel.

**~DAY 7~**

* We woke up early and headed back to Keflavík.  The skies cleared up so we had some amazing sunrise views for the drive.

Phew.  Some last stray thoughts:

* We spent about $40/day on breakfast and lunch from the grocery store (the pre-made sandwiches are much better than you can get in the U.S.) and $110/day on restaurants which is not that different from a restaurant experience in an American urban area.
* We drove about 1,250 miles in total so we probably could have done the Ring Road, but we decided that we wanted to stay two nights at each location and not pack up every day.

Comment,,gerundium-1,2024-08-23 14:32:54,"Thanks for the writeup, i just drafted our itinerary for early september and just asked for feedback. it's confidence inspiring to see your trip in some days matches our plans quite well. 

The pictures look amazing, sadly by the time we arrive the puffins will be gone most likely. Those shots you got of them are killer.",1,
Comment,,BelowReplacementLvl,2024-08-23 15:18:39,Thanks!  I bought a fancy Nikon D7500 camera with a 70-300mm lens to take bird pictures without having to know much about photography and it really works - just point and click!  My pics are the seal and the puffin.  The rest of the pics are from my wife's google pixel phone.  You should definitely check out Dyrhólaey just in case the puffins are still there!  I see that you are getting a 4WD so you will be able to see more out-of-the-way places.  Your itinerary looks good - just make sure you stay flexible because several hikes took us longer than anticipated and also: be careful of the jet lag.  I got pretty tired driving all over the place after landing on very little plane sleep.  Some of the roads have steep drop offs and you wouldn't want to roll your car!,2,

Post,"July/Aug 2024 - 17 days - Campervan around Iceland - Trip Report - Detailed, Tips & Learnings",Wilks95,2024-08-20 19:38:35,"# Intro

Well, the dream holiday has concluded. Reddit was by far the best resource when I spent months researching and planning my trip. So now I feel it's only fair to give back to this community and hopefully provide some useful information, our learnings, tips and if we’d done anything differently.

Firstly I will explain my goals for the trip and some background information. Iceland has been my dream destination for a holiday and it is the longest and most expensive I’ve been on. I had been looking at how much it would cost to visit and one day in July 23 a campervan rental company dropped some major discounts for holidays booked the following year. I made a snap decision and booked the campervan then and there. 

The dreaded year-long wait for the holiday had begun, but this wasn’t all so bad as it gave me heaps of time to research and plan the perfect itinerary, I probably spent around 50 hours researching and planning my trip and I do have some regrets about spending this much time, some thoughts on that in the learnings section later. 

My partner (27 f) and I (28 m) would be considered ‘active’ travellers, not in terms of fitness but in the sense that we are not going on holiday to sit around and relax, we want to see and do as much as we can, this is reflected in the amount of planning and intensity within the itinerary.

Our trip ran from Sun 28th July through to Tuesday 13th August, we visited every region of Iceland apart from the westfjords and the highlands.

I am sure there will be plenty of things I will forget to mention so please feel free to answer any specific questions in the comments, I will endeavour to reply to you.

I will split this post into multiple sections for easier reading:-

* Intro
* Planning
* Flights
* Campervan
* Day by day Itinerary
* Campsites
* Weather, Driving and Roads
* Tips
* Learnings & what we do differently
* Costs

# Planning

Reddit and Tripadvisor were my primary resources for planning my itinerary. I’m a believer that user generated reviews are far more informative as to whether something would suit your holiday or is worth the time. Website articles can be useful but I am cautious that these sites are often created to generate ad or affiliate revenue.

Tripadvisor is a fantastic starting place, just try this and see how it works for you. Take a region of iceland that you will be travelling in, let's say the westfjords for example. Search westfjords in tripadvisor and then the ‘things to do’ option. Click ‘see all’ on the ‘top attractions’ and you now have a list ordered by ratings from most popular to least. This is how I started to piece together a list of things that I wanted to try and fit in the itinerary. You can also bring up a map view of the attractions that can help you work out what may be close to the area you are travelling.

# Flights

We live in the United Kingdom so flew between London Heathrow (LHR) and Keflavik Airport (KEF) with IcelandAir with around a 3 hour flight time.

I booked the flights in November 2023 around 8-9 months before our trip. I don’t believe the flights became any cheaper closer to the time as I was still receiving google flight notifications up until the trip. One thing to be wary of booking this far in advance is that our plane changed aircraft type at some point after I had originally booked (probably due to demand) and this meant my selected seats were changed and I was not informed, so about 3 weeks before our flight I had noticed this and my partner and I were not seated next to each other, fortunately I was able to change our seats in the app at not cost to seat us together.

Both our arriving and leaving flights went fairly smoothly with a slight delay leaving KEF. Complimentary small drink on board and the infotainment system was great. Ended up watching Dune part two on the way and Wonka on our return. Made the flight pass by in no time at all.

Heathrow we had a manned check-in and Keflavik we had to self check-in our bags. Other than weighing our checked bags we were never checked for our hand luggage or backpacks sizes.

At Keflavik Airport the queue for the tax refund was fairly long and it took around 20-30 minutes before we got to the desk. Keep this in mind if you are planning to make some claims.

# Campervan

We ended up going with the rental company Campeasy for our camper due to some really good discounts offered which made the rental much cheaper compared to the competitors at the time.

We rented the ‘Easy Fun X’ option which was a 2WD Manual 2020 VW Transporter. This is what they call an ‘eXperienced’ campervan in that it has been used for a couple of years and had done around 150,000 kilometres. It was approximately £200 cheaper to take the experienced version over a newer vehicle. We had a fridge, sink with a water tap, heater and standalone gas stoves. The configuration of the inside of the camper is nearly identical to all similar options from other rental companies with the exception of cosycampers which have a different layout.

We were collected by shuttle and taken to the Campeasy base where we were given our ipad and told to watch a varying number of introductory videos on how the campervan works, driving tips etc. In total probably around 20 minutes of videos whilst on a comfy sofa with free hot drinks available.

I took the option to check-in online 7 days before our trip which involved uploading driving license details which will save you time when you are actually there, worth doing.

We were then given keys to the camper and collected our box of extras from the office. The extras available on their website were really good, slightly expensive for some items but overall really good selection. We paid for unlimited Wifi, 2 rental towels, an inverter to charge batteries via plugs and extra gas bottles for our camping stoves. They also offered free fun items such as a campeasy songbook, branded sunglasses etc and many useful options like a laundry rack to hang on the wing mirrors or extra blankets.

Being an ‘eXperienced’ campervan we did have some minor/trivial issues on our trip such as:-

* Outrageously powerful water tap that would splash back against the sink and all over the worktop and floor. Was quite frustrating and I couldn't really use it for much other than filling water bottles or a quick splash of water to fill the sink to wash some kitchenware.
* Both the passenger and sliding side door would frequently not latch properly so we’d have to keep opening and slamming doors until they did. Driver door sometimes refused to open from the outside.
* Our table mount physically snapped off when taking it down to put into bed configuration, you could clearly see that this had been repaired before and our table was wobbly the whole time. We couldn’t organise a repair of the table until a week into our trip when we got to Akureyri but to be fair they were able to repair it within 20 minutes and have us on our way. We actually decided that the table mount breaking made the experience in the back of the camper much more spacious and led me to feel that the cosycamper layout would actually be more favourable for us.
* This one is not specific to the campervan but campeasy themselves were having a software issue on their iPads and therefore we could not use the iPad for navigation for the entirety of the trip, luckily with unlimited wifi we could just use our phones for navigation. They did refund the entire cost of the Wifi addon for the inconvenience of this software issue. This was affecting all their rentals.

Apart from the above points the campervan performed excellently throughout our whole trip, would it have been worth it to spend £200 extra for a less used newer model? I’m not quite sure. If you take into account there is some level of reliability increase and could guarantee all our minor issues wouldn’t occur then, maybe, perhaps but I don’t think it’s that necessary from my experience. 

My biggest regret was not having cruise control as an option, the amount of attention this frees up for you whilst driving is not to be underestimated and gives the driver far more ability to enjoy the scenery. Cruise control didn’t seem to be an option on the VW transporters no matter what configuration I would have paid for, it would require upsizing to a larger van, probably to the point it's not worth the money for 2 people.

 

# Day by day Itinerary

Note - We changed our sleep pattern to wake at 4am and be out of the campsites by 6am most days. It gave us many wonderful places to ourselves.

# Day 1

* Flight into KEF Airport, grabbed alcohol from duty free
* Taxi from the airport to Hotel Berg in Keflavik cost us £25
* Visited the giantess cave near the hotel and went out for dinner at Anton’s Mamma Mia.
* Hotel had a rooftop pool so chilled for the evening.

# Day 2

* Got a free shuttle to campeasy headquarters which is only a few minutes down the road.
* Completed the pickup process (detailed further down in the campervan section)
* Made our way to [\~Bonus\~ ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HNqfzApQM9nCnk3Z7)10 minutes down the road to stock up on supplies.
* Drove straight to thingvellir national park, did the loop walk around the houses of parliament and oxararfoss waterfall. We brought bug nets on holiday for Lake Myvatn but we got caught out not having these in our backpack here! Infact the only place we visited that had midges all over us.
* Drive to bruarfoss waterfall to the newer parking lot that allows only a 5 minute walk to the falls rather than the parking with a longer hike. Really beautiful waterfall, quite unique and beautiful blue glacier water.
* Skjol camping for the night (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 3

* Early wake up and a short drive to Gullfoss waterfall, absolutely magnificent and only about 8 people here at this time in the morning. Not sure if it was just the time of day but there were no informative plaques or boards to provide information about the waterfall, and I actually found a lack of information on many of the sites around iceland.
* Short drive again to Geysir which I really enjoyed, never experienced anything like this before and it was definitely worth the stop.
* Over to Faxafoss, another lovely waterfall, although it was a paid entry for a short stop, I would say it would be optional for that reason.
* Next to Kerid Crater, this may be bias because it was the first crater we saw but it was our favourite on the whole trip, a short walk around the top rim and then also able to walk around the lower inner circle. The stairs are short but fairly steep so it's a good huff to get back up.
* Next we made our way to Urridafoss with a quick stop in Selfoss on the way as we’d wanted to get a few more items we missed on our first supermarket trip. Urridafoss is definitely not the most magnificent waterfall in Iceland but it's a short diversion from the ring road and worth it if you have time but skippable if not.
* Langbrok camping for the night (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 4

* Busy day and early rise again
* First to Seljalandsfoss and the nearby Gljufrabui, absolutely stunning and one of the best stops you can make on the whole ring road. Again, no one here both waterfalls to our complete self, got some amazing pictures behind seljalandsfoss and maybe our best pictures of the whole trip on Gljufrabui’s boulder.
* Skogafoss next, a mighty waterfall indeed and worth the stop. We did not climb the stairs to the top mainly because of our tight schedule but secondly because it looked tiring but I’ve heard reviews that it is worth the climb if you have the time. There were a few people around by now due to a campsite nearby but we managed to get some pictures without any people in them.
* Kvernufoss is located a couple minute drive from Skogafoss and we had this one to ourselves. This one is really stunning, the bright green foliage surrounded by the dark rocks was picturesque. Another waterfall you can go underneath as well.
* Towards Dyrholaey viewpoint which I didn’t think was going to be too amazing but to my surprise, Puffins! Hundreds of them and really really close up. This was our best moment of seeing puffins during our whole trip, highly recommended in the summer season. Unfortunately it was quite foggy this day so we couldn’t really see Reynisfjara beach too well. There are 2 car parks at this attraction, the eastern viewpoint is where all the puffins were and the western viewpoint did not have puffins but had great views of the long black sand beaches. We went to both but if you only had time for 1 I would say the eastern for the puffins.
* Onto Reynisfjara beach where by now it's 1pm and absolutely jam packed, could barely fit in the parking area. Our first proper look at basalt columns and they were fantastic but definitely not the best formation on the island. It was so busy here that it kind of took the magic away a bit, we got our first pylsur (hot dog) from a food truck for only 750 kr each. Good stuff.
* Fueled up on our drive through Vik and headed to Fjaorargljufur canyon, heavy fog and some light rain descended upon this canyon which took some of the views and magic away for sure but it was still worth the short walk. The end viewpoint is the scariest sh\*t in Iceland even though it's a metal structure but if you're scared of heights, don’t look down! 
* Tjaldstaedid Kirkjubaer campsite (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 5 

* We woke up and drove around the corner to visit Stjornarfoss, a small waterfall but shadowed by tall cliff faces. We had this to ourselves and really enjoyed it for what it was.
* We made our drive towards Skaftafell with a few stops on the way to Foss a Siou and Dverghamrar. Foss a siou is actually the 8th tallest waterfall in Iceland and is on private property that doesn’t really have access or parking. It’s a good 5 minute stop to admire and take some photos but nothing more to do. Dverghamrar were some cool cliffs said to be home to elves or dwarves. Good for a quick stop but I wouldn’t say this was a must do for me.
* A decent drive from here to Skaftafell and Svartifoss parking, originally had planned to walk to both the glacier and Svartifoss waterfall but quickly realised I had not anticipated the amount of time needed for that and we had an activity booked at a specific time later in the day. We ended up choosing to do the glacier hike which I really enjoyed, very different scenery to a lot of iceland. When I next go back to Iceland I will definitely do the Svartifoss walk. I also loved this long drive across flat lava fields whilst you can see the massive glacier getting closer and closer. Beautiful.
* Unfortunately this is where things changed for the worse and a big storm rolled in, our first proper Icelandic rain on our drive to Fjallsarlon Glacier, Jokulsarlon and diamond beach. One of the stops I was most looking forward to on our trip and the weather had completely ruined it, we were wet sodden and demoralised (yes we had full waterproofs). They ended up cancelling our Jokulsarlon Zodiac boat tour due to the weather and I must admit I had deep disappointment and was worried that maybe the weather was going to make my whole Iceland dream and not live up to expectations. (This is where researching, planning and looking at the gorgeous photos of the attractions looking their best is a recipe for disappointment, try to avoid this in your planning. I hope on our next visit to Iceland we have good weather for this part of Iceland as I think it has the potential to be amazing.
* Feeling slightly down we decided to stop in Hofn for some dinner at [\~Hafnarbudin.\~](https://maps.app.goo.gl/saAXmdrGNvBGQw266) It was quite small and we were lucky to get a seat but wow the food here was amazing and super affordable compared to the rest of Iceland.
* Onto Vestrahorn campsite which was sadly also covered in fog (Check campsite section for some info).

# Day 6

* Well the storm was still raging on, luckily this day was scheduled to be a big driving day through the eastfjords so we only had a few brief stops planned. Although this was fortunate for keeping us dry it absolutely killed what I think could of been the most beautiful driving in the country, winding through all the fjords you turn the bend to another new beautiful landscape, or that’s atleast what I had hoped, instead we had cloud and fog that meant we could only see 1/3rd at the base of the mountains.
* My partner's waterproof shoes had also been destroyed in yesterday's storm and the sole had completely torn away. We had no choice, we had to find an outdoor clothing store today.
* Our first stop was Nykurhylsfoss, a surprisingly picturesque waterfall and I would highly recommend it on your drive through the fjords. There is also a portaloo here, although I'm not sure it gets cleaned much…
* Another long drive and a stop at a pullover for lunch where supposedly there existed a sea geysir and possible sightings of seals. We made a brief effort to start this walk but it was so boggy, wet and foggy we had to just turn back to the camper. Would like to try this spot for lunch on a dry day.
* I managed to find a shop on google maps called Veidiflugan on a short detour to a town called Reydarfjordur. We found some great new walking boots for my partner and the staff here were fantastic and explained to us for the first time about the tax refund system. A very unexpected and expensive purchase compared to home but completely necessary for the holiday to continue.
* Now toward Seydisfjordur, the storm is still pounding away. I’d heard such great things about this town and the drive in but obviously due to the weather I couldn’t really see more than 50 metres. The town was pretty empty but we visited the rainbow street and the 2 souvenir shops. I’m not really sure it was worth the drive for the type of holiday we were on, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more with the views.
* Onto atlavik campsite and we had driven inland out of the storm on the coastline. It was so peaceful and quiet and my mood started to shift as I knew the following day was set to be dry. (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 7

* Ahhh waking up in the peaceful forest surrounding Atlavik, and the storm has passed and given way to a decently bright morning.
* 10 minute drive to Hengifoss car park and we are the first ones here this morning and complete our hike to Hengifoss before a few others join us later on. There is a not so clear path that you can continue once you reach the viewpoint, we followed this for a little bit to get a slightly closer view but honestly it gets pretty technical and slow progression. We didn’t get too close and turned back around completing the loop on the way down. The litlanesfoss waterfall halfway on the walk to Hengifoss was a lovely surprise and I would argue it's just as impressive as hengifoss. This is a must do hike in my opinion.
* We then pushed on a long drive to Studlagil Canyon, once you turn off the main road onto the road that has no number it gets really rough and bumpy. We managed it fine in the 2WD but its a decent drive at a slow pace to get there. You may see from other tips on this attraction that it is well worth to drive over the bridge past the first car park to the second car park as it is by far worth cutting that walking time off as the walk from the first car park is not scenic and is essentially just walking on the road. Second car park was super busy but had toilets. Shortish walk to the canyon’s themselves and wow these basalt columns are a must see, it is absolute ridden with tourists at busy time of the day but nonetheless you can find some quiet areas away to enjoy the surroundings.
* We head on a decent drive to Myvatn Bjarg campsite (Check campsite section for some info)
* We had fish and chips from the restaurant across the road and it was really tasty and fairly priced.
* One of my favourite days of the holiday.

# Day 8

* Oh my our first blue sunshine morning and what a treat to visit Leirhnjukur (clay hill) and the Krafla lava fields, again our early morning rise gives our entire 2 hour walk all to ourselves, really added to the magic of this experience and so amazing to see lava that is less than 50 years old (I believe), you can walk right up to the crater and even jump across some cracks in the lava. Really really cool hike and I think it was my favourite of the whole trip.
* We then moved onto Viti crater and honestly this was pretty mediocre for me, something I learnt from this holiday is that the craters whilst look amazing from a distance and the science behind them is great, they are just all quite similar and often walking around the rim of the craters in a busy itinerary is not worth it. We stopped for some quick pictures and the colour of the water was really cool, but moved on. Probably worth the stop as it's so close to the krafla lava fields but I wouldn’t go there again.
* We had our next activity booked at the Myvatn Nature Baths and had a really great time, spent around 2.5-3 hours here, surprisingly cheap drinks in the lagoon bar and interesting to explore the lagoon finding really hot spots and some cooler ones. A nice change of pace from our busy active schedule. Reasonably priced I would say it's worth it.
* We then popped to the Grjotagja cave (game of thrones cave), it was alright but can’t support too many visitors. Skippable for me.
* This is where the first major diversion of my planned itinerary happened, we really did not enjoy our stay at Myvatn Bjarg campsite so decided that we would push to Husavik and Camping 66.12 North and then start our itinerary backwards the next day as we planned to end up at this campsite that day anyway.
* Husavik is by far our favourite town that we visited, beautiful views, church and souvenir shops, although the lack of public toilets was slightly annoying. I love the Husavik song from the Eurovision movie so we played that as we drove into the town for the first time x).
* Ended the night at Camping 66.12 north (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 9

* Up early again and off to Asbyrgi canyon, again we had our entire stay here all to ourselves. So beautiful and peaceful when you can stay completely silent and hear the ducks waking up. Nice walks through forests and adds a different vibe to other areas of iceland.
* Next stop was the Hljodakletter hike which passed the lava church, properly known as ‘Kirkjan’, we arrived here and completed the entire hike again to ourselves. This was probably the most technical walk of our trip and luckily it was dry for us, I would honestly think this is a pretty sketchy hike in the rain standing on flat basalt columns. The deformations of the columns where the lava has cooled fast makes for some amazing formations and the Kirkjan cave is fantastic, this was definitely worth the hike.
* This is where we had a funny interaction with the national park rangers. We were just about to leave after completing our hike, suddenly the ranger's vehicle pulled quite aggressively in front of us to stop us from leaving. We were very confused about the actions until the ranger got out of his car and retrieved a pouch from the back of his car and approached our window. The ranger had assumed that we had parked in this car park and had slept overnight. You would love to see the look on his face when we told him we had already been to Asbyrgi canyon, then completed the 2 hour hljodaklettar hike and that we were on our way to Dettifoss. One thing I learnt about Icelandic people is that they really don’t like to wake up early haha.
* Onward to Dettifoss the second most powerful waterfall in Europe. Oh my god please for your own sake wear sunglasses, hat, snood, gaiter, balaclava whatever you can because on a windy day there is so much grit and sand whipping up off the floor, you are just blind for the entire walk. Big regrets. The waterfall itself was magnificent, a must see if you come out this way. Make sure you head to the western parking lot as the road is paved, the eastern parking lot is a very long unpaved road.
* We head back toward the Myvatn area and to Hverfjall crater, this is quite a short but steep climb. The views of the surroundings are great from the top but again I didn’t really feel that amazed by actually being at the top and we never felt it necessary to walk the rim. Honestly the rim walk on this crater looked like it would take hours. Skippable.
* Drive back to Camping 66.12 north.

# Day 10

* The best weather yet! Bright blue skies!
* Headed to Oxarfjorour view point where we saw some more puffins and other various birds, not as close a view as Dyrholaey but still a nice morning.
* Whale watching with Gentle Giants in Husavik, and the most perfect weather of the whole holiday to go with it, calm seas and pure sunshine. A stark contrast from the cancelled glacier lagoon tour.
* Unfortunately we only saw dolphins and a humpback whale occasionally surfacing to breathe in the distance only to rush to the location for him to pop up somewhere else 15 mins later. I did not get to see the whales body :(. Quite a big disappointment as this was the one thing I really wanted to see on the trip, nothing wrong with the company doing the tour its just natures luck.
* Headed to Godafoss, a decent waterfall but fairly busy at this point of the day, definitely worth the stop though.
* We headed into Akureyri as campeasy had organised our table in the campervan to be repaired, I dropped my partner off to do some shopping in Akureyri and drove to the workshop. To be fair to them it only took 30 minutes to get it all sorted and we were back on the way.
* We went to the Akureyri botanical gardens which were beautiful but we were so tired at this point we couldn’t really enjoy it that much.
* We left Akureyri to head to out next campsite Varmahlid (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 11

* A big driving day to head to Snaefellsnes peninsula.
* A rainy and foggy morning we planned various stops along our drive to break up the driving into chunks. First was the Vatnsdalsholar viewpoint but due to the weather the view didn’t really exist so this was a lacklustre stop.
* Onto Kolugljufur canyon which was okay, it's a worthy stop to have a break from driving but I did not find it that special.
* The first flaw in my research! Road 54… this northern part of the road is the worst road we drove on the entire trip to my shock. I assumed a 2 digit road was going to be easy driving considering most 3 digit roads are paved. This is just kilometres and kilometres of hell and you don’t really want to drive slow because it would take you all day. Also no toilets anywhere! I haven’t really looked into it but I wonder if continuing along route 1 and then going into the peninsula on the southern part and then coming back out on the southern road may be better. The north east of the peninsula doesn’t have too much to stop at until you get to Kirkjufell.
* We drove to Kirkjufell and the sun briefly came out with blue skies when we arrived. A really beautiful part of the country and the town of Grundarfjordur is a great stop for a cafe lunch or drink. We sat outside in Kaffi 59 with views of Kirkjufell.
* We started our drive toward our planned campsite in Olafviks, we pulled in fairly early due to our schedule but there was a really strange vibe from a big group of campers that honestly reminded me of traveller families and they kind of blocked the entrance to the campsite. I don’t really think anything was wrong but it just felt a bit odd so we went to another campsite Hellissandur, which was one of our favourites, so glad we did.  (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 12

* A short drive to Svodufoss and a short walk to reach the falls, we had this to ourselves and this waterfall was an unexpected surprise. It is a beautifully formed small waterfall with a small basalt column formation. Very picturesque.
* Next we hit Skardsvik beach and Svortuloft lighthouse, both of these were nice visits to ourselves but certainly wouldn’t say they are must sees, the road is unpaved gravel with potholes but it was something different to what we had been seeing.
* Saxholl crater was next and the steps up to the rim were so weirdly spaced it was odd, you wanted to do 2 steps at a time but it was slightly too far of a stride to be comfortable. Much like my other opinions on the craters, much of the same but a nice view of lava fields surrounding. The nice thing about the craters is that it is never hard or long to reach the main attraction or viewpoint so they are worth a visit.
* Next was Londrangar cliffs and Arnarstapi and our first sighting of an Arctic Fox! We were looking out over the cliffs and my partner told me to turn around and there was an Arctic fox standing 5 metres from us patrolling the cliffs for a meal. Amazing to see up close alot cuter than the British fox.
* We had a walk around Arnarstapi and had lunch in the Stapinn restaurant which was fine, very busy with lots of tourist buses in Arnarstapi.
* We then went to Raudfeldsgja Gorge and wow this thing is stunning from a distance, we made the walk inside the gorge which contained some technical rock jumping over a decently fast flowing stream, waterproof boots highly recommended here. Quite a sweet experience inside the gorge although we didn’t go in too far as it gets pretty impassable quite fast. Our second Arctic fox sighting upon exiting the gorge, this time he was a little bit further away.
* Getting tired we headed to Bjarnarfoss which really can be viewed from the car park, there is a fairly hefty hike if you want to get up to the falls but we knackered at this point.
* Off to Snorrastadir camping (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 13

* Early morning rise to Landbrotalaug hot springs which is a free natural small hole in the ground that can fit about 2-3 people and it's super warm with gorgeous views of the mountains around. We got this for an hour to ourselves but I can imagine it can get busy and maybe people have to end up queueing to get in.
* We then drove to Grabrok crater, well by now I'm really not that interested in craters anymore. I wish there were a bit more information boards at the top of the craters to maybe explain more about their compositions and such.
* Glanni waterfall was next, paid parking for a short walk to a mediocre waterfall. I would probably skip this.
* Deildartunguhver hot springs next and these ones we could not bathe in as they are 100 degrees bubbling out the ground. A short neat stop and we grabbed a pylsur in the food hut nearby and sat in their greenhouse warmed by the geothermal power, a nice location.
* Final stop at Hraunfossar & Barnafoss, the former being a really unique waterfall, it stretches so wide it's amazing how nature has formed this.
* Another dilemma in our itinerary, I noticed from looking up our next campsite on the road that the owner locks the gates to the campsite at night meaning you can’t get out until 8am. Obviously our early schedule wasn’t really compatible with this. We had planned for the Glymur waterfall hike the day after but we were really flagging at this point of the holiday and weren’t sure we really wanted to do a big hike. Brainstormed a bit and ended up returning to our previous campsite at Snorrastadir and planned to do a cave activity the following day.

# Day 14

* Heading off to the Cave vidgelmir which is a large lava tube in a 52km lava field. This was well worth the trip and was really informative and adventurous, a great tour guide.
* We then headed to the geothermal energy exhibition, which was a really great place and helped you understand the whole process of how Iceland harnesses geothermal energy. Might not be for everyone.
* We made our way to Strandakrikja camping (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 15

* My birthday! We had blue lagoon booked for 7am, it was cheaper to go at this time and a lot quieter as we were the first group in, by the time we left 10 it was very busy. Did the whole 3 facemasks and tried the juices and blueberry slushies. It’s bigger and has more steam rooms and baths and the facilities are nicer than Myvatn nature baths. I think it's worth doing once when you come to Iceland, if I came back again I’d probably try sky lagoon.
* My itinerary from this point was written with the expectation that Grindavik would be open, which it still currently isn’t. Instead we went straight to Reykjavik and changed our Lava show booking to an earlier time.
* The lava show was interesting and we learned a fair bit about past eruptions and different types of eruption. I did kind of expect to see a bit more lava than we did, because of the small amount they pour down their channel, once it reaches the end it cools very very quickly and blackens into a glass like texture. So you only see flowing molten lava once for about 1 minute whilst he still has time to manipulate it. Again I would say it was worth doing but I wouldn’t return for a second visit.
* We had dinner out in Reykjavik and then returned to Reykjamörk Hveragerði campsite (Check campsite section for some info)

# Day 16

* This was our reykjavik day and we didn’t do anything other than visit the Hallgrimskirkja church which was really lacklustre. Looks great on the outside but it's so boring and modern on the inside. I guess I’m blessed with living in the UK with stained glass windows. 
* My partner spent the rest of the day wading through souvenir shops whilst I was dragged along.
* Had some crepes and lunch downtown.
* We used the[ \~free parking\~](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j6jD4TSv3TGAJwBZ8) which was a 20 minute walk from the main rainbow street and served us well as it was easy to reach from the main roads.
* We returned to Reykjamörk Hveragerði campsite and began doing some packing for our flight the following day

# Day 17

* Pack up and leave!

Post,5 day Iceland camper route,Luisio93,2024-08-20 10:45:26,"Hello!

This is my first post here. Next week (24th to 31th Aug), me and some friends are visiting Iceland in camper for 5 days. With the help of chatgpt I made a first outline of the route Id like to do. I am aware that it is a bit overextended, so the only goal of this post is to know if this route is too long for 5 days, and if so, what should I remove in the opinion of more expertised iceland travelers here.

Besides, my father told me that the outer circle roads are okey but there are lots of speed signals and traffic. Are the road times that gpt wrote accurate in August?

For us, our must are:

* Best waterfalls to watch and get to.
* Seeing puffins and seals if able
* One or two activities like snorkelling or the glaciar caves visit
* Reynisfjara

We would also like to go around the outer circle, following the main road as the camper is not 4x4 and we will visit iceland again with a proper vehicle to follow f roads and so.

[This is the route on my maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1OWAet9Nt7atEw9HmU2rhmQw7dZLl2-k&usp=sharing), and I will paste here an automatic translated copy of our itinerary (sorry, dont have the time to properly translate it to english haha):

Post,"10 Days Around the Ring Road — Itinerary, Tips, & Lessons Learned 
",IntroductionSea811,2024-08-18 20:29:32,"We had an amazing time in Iceland August 1-11! We are a couple in our 20s. Thank you for all your help on this sub!! Paying it back by sharing our itinerary and lessons learned.

**Day 1: Reykjavik**

Sundholl pool, Sandholt, Hallgrimskirkja, Phallological Museum, stock up at Bonus, stay at Guesthouse Pavi in Reykjavik

We left in the evening the day before from Dulles. Arrived at KEF at 5am the next morning. PLAY airline — no issues but the seats were very uncomfortable, which was especially annoying when we were trying to sleep through the flight. Picked up rental car at the Hertz station in the airport — easy. Drove straight to Sundholl pool in Reykjavik. Very relaxing and felt amazing after the cramped flight. Cheap and not crowded. Sandholt was delicious. We hit a wall after and had a great nap in the car. The Hallgrimskirkja tower view is great. Phallological Museum is kind of gross but cool! Kaffi Loki for dinner was great.

**Day 2: Golden Circle**

Silfra snorkeling, Thingvellir National Park, Fridheimer for lunch, Geysir, Gulfoss, stay at Paradise Cave Hostel & Guesthouse in Hvolsvöllur 

Silfra was amazing, highly recommend doing it first thing in the morning. We left Reykjavik at 7am, and we went to sleep early the night before because of jet lag/traveling, so it wasn’t bad. Also Thingvellir was nearly empty at 8am. By the time we were done snorkeling at 10, it was much more crowded. Everything on this day was crowded, but it was okay. Now that we’ve seen these main sites, next time we’d love to do an actual hike in the area instead. Fridheimar food wasn’t mind-blowing, but it was a cool experience, especially since we love gardening and learning about farms.

**Day 3: South Coast**

Seljalandsfoss & Gljufrabui, Skogar, Reynisfjara, Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon, Eldhraun lava fields, Skaftafell, stay at Hotel Smyrlabjorg in Þjóðvegur (between the glacier lagoons and Höfn) 

The first two waterfalls were 5 min from our accommodations, so we went there first thing in the morning and practically had them to ourselves! Amazing way to start the day. We skipped walking up Skogafoss and instead spent time at the nearby Skogar Museum. It was not crowded, and we enjoyed the museum and turf houses. The weather was terrible this day — heavy rain and wind. Reynisfjara was very unpleasant. We were supposed to drive to Vatnajokull for an afternoon glacier hike but it was canceled due to high winds. So we spent more time at the canyon and lava field instead, which were both great. We still stopped by Skaftafell National Park — wish we could have spent more time here at least viewing the glacier and hiking. 

Our hotel was 20-30 min north of the glacier lagoons, which we planned to stop by on our way. However, the drive from Skaftafell to the hotel took double the expected time due to weather — it was a scary drive during a yellow alert for rain and wind. I wish we didn’t have to drive that far, but there weren’t many accommodations options in our budget for this night that still kept us close enough to the lagoons for our boat tour the next morning. 

**Day 4: Glacier Lagoons and Drive to Eastfjords**

Fjallsárlón Glacier Lagoon Zodiac boat tour, Jökulsárlón and Diamond Beach, drive to Eastfjords, stay at Eidavellir Apartments and Rooms in Egilsstaðir 

Despite the cold and heavy rain, we loved the boat tour — we even saw a big chunk of ice break off one of the icebergs! By the time we went to Jökulsárlón, it was crowded and fog obscured the view. Diamond Beach wasn’t impressive (no big chunks of ice at that time), but we enjoyed the educational panels nearby. The drive to Egilsstaðir took such a long time and was mostly unpleasant due to heavy rain. We had to skip all the planned stops along the way. After all that driving and the bad weather, we sadly did not make the hourlong drive up to the puffins spot :( 

**Day 5: Geothermal area/Myvatn and Husavik**

Dettifoss, Krafla, Hverir, Grjotagja, Skútustaðir, Geosea, stay at Hagi 1 Guesthouse in Aðaldalur (25 min from Husavik) 

We finally saw the sun! Very pleasant weather for seeing all the sites today. All were great. It really did stink of sulfur though! Wish we could have gone on longer walks/hikes. Lots of nice options for dinner at Husavik. Geosea was an incredible post-dinner experience — we even got a beautiful sunset. 

**Day 6: Whale Watching in Husavik and Akureyri** 

Whale watching tour, whale museum, Svalbarðseyri (quick photo stop at the lighthouse), Akureyri pool and Botanic Garden, stay at Acco Guesthouse in Akureyri 

The weather was bad in the morning, and there was only one whale that we got a few glimpses of. It happens. But the sea was very rough and I was extremely seasick and ill on the boat 😩 most people were uncomfortable at best, sick at worst. It really ruined most of the day for me, unfortunately. I didn’t take dramamine because of needing to drive. I wore sea bands, which had been helpful for preventing motion sickness when using my phone in the car, but were no match for the lurching boat. We spent more time in Husavik just recovering and skipped Godafoss. The Akureyri pool was really fun, and we loved walking through the Botanic Garden at sunset!  

**Day 7: Tröllaskagi Peninsula**

Siglufjörður (Herring Era Museum & Folk Music Center), Hofsos, Glaumbaer Farm & Museum, Reykjafoss, stay at Guesthouse Tilraun in Blönduós

Really enjoyed walking around Siglufjörður and checking out all the museum buildings and the music center. We didn’t feel like swimming in the middle of the day, but it was cool to see the view from Hofsos, and there’s a nice little walk on the cliffs above the water over there. Glaumbaer was okay, it was the end of the day and I was kind of museum’ed out. Reykjafoss was nice and we took a dip in the natural hot springs in the freezing cold, although we later felt unsure if that was safe 😬…fwiw there were plenty of other people doing it. 

**Day 8: North Coast to Snaefellsness**

Kolugljúfur, Icelandic Seal Center, Eiriksstadir, Erpsstaðir Creamery, Berserkjahraun, Kirkjufell, stay at the Old Post Office Guesthouse in Grundarfjörður

We were getting tired at this point in the trip, and decided to skip Borgarviki, Hvitserkur, and Stykkishólmur. But Kolugljúfur was nice. We made an impromptu stop at the Icelandic Seal Center — while it wasn’t the right time of day to see seals, we actually had a great view of multiple whales from the shore! Even better than what we had seen on the boat tour! We loved Eiriksstadir — the guides were great, they were locals who seemed genuinely interested in learning about how the vikings lived and sharing that knowledge. It’s small, but we spent a while hanging out there before getting delicious ice cream at nearby Erpsstaðir. Then we drove to Grundarfjörður, with a stop off for views of the lava fields and mountains on the way. We went to Kirkjufell for sunset — not a great sunset since it was cloudy, but we still enjoyed it.

**Day 9: Snaefellsness Peninsula**

Skarðsvík Beach, Saxhollar crater, Djupalonssandur Beach, Vatnshellir lava cave tour, Snaefellsjokull National Park, Arnarstapi, Ytri Tunga Beach, stay at 101 Guesthouse Hotel in Reykjavik 

There is so much to see and do on the peninsula! We still had to make it back to Reykjavik at the end of the day so we didn’t have time for everything, and we would have loved to spend more time walking/hiking in some of these beautiful areas. The weather was pretty good too. It was much less crowded here than in the first part of the trip, and most sites have free parking. Note that there were fewer bathrooms, cafes, gift shops, etc. in this area. The lava cave tour was fairly short and not too expensive, worth doing if you have the time/budget for it. We saw lots of seals at Ytri Tunga but it was a tough walk over slippery rocks to get close enough to see them well. 

**Day 10: Reykjavik** 

Braud & Co, Harpa, Sun Voyager, National Museum, get to KEF at noon for flight home

Sorry, the cinnamon rolls at Braud & Co were way overhyped. I preferred the pastries at Sandholt. Harpa was not fully open that early — wish we could have gone later in the day and would have loved to catch a performance. We missed National Museum the first day so we squeezed it in, but it was less impactful at the end of the trip, and we only had an hour to spend there. We got to the airport 3 hours early, returned the rental car, and had plenty of time to get food and relax before boarding (even after being randomly selected for extra security screening).

**General Comments**

* I think I confused “most people rent a car — it’s the best way to get around” with “most people drive the entire Ring Road.” Driving the whole country in 10 days on our first visit was definitely ambitious and adventurous! While it sucked feeling rushed at times and having to miss out on some things, it was an amazing accomplishment and we loved getting a feel for the whole country. We were taking note of what we want to do/where to spend more time when we hopefully come back! 
* You could literally just drive the Ring Road and never get out of the car and the views are amazing (if it’s not too foggy) 
* Our Hyundai i20 worked perfectly fine for everything we wanted to do. It was small but modern, with carplay for both iPhone and Android, cruise control, lane sense, and other helpful safety features.
* The pools are amazing! Even the local public pools are cheap and clean. The whole cleaning routine is legit though — hope you’re comfortable with nudity! 
* My carrier (AT&T) offers a $12/day international plan where I can use my phone like normal. I was impressed with the coverage — the data was often better than hotel wifi, and it was easy to use maps and whatever else in the car. There were only 1 or 2 spots where I had no signal at all, and they were off the main road.
* We booked the cheapest accommodations available in the area we needed to stay in (limited options booking 2 months in advance for high season), and they were all fine, and some were even really nice! We were pleasantly surprised. Almost all the places we stayed had shared bathrooms, and it was not a problem — there were often multiple individual rooms with toilets and multiple individual rooms with showers/toilets, so we never had to wait. All had shared kitchens where we could refrigerate food overnight. Only a few had dining service/breakfast included, but that was okay since we often wanted to get moving in the morning and ate in the car.
* We brought some favorite snacks/granola bars from home and also bought some stuff at Bonus. Snacks and PB&Js saved us on days when we didn’t have time/didn’t want to stop for lunch. We mostly did not plan out meals and either stopped for dinner on the way to our accommodations or checked in and then found a place to eat, depending on timing. 
* We took a thousand photos and still nothing compares to being there!!!
* Also, some things just don’t look as amazing as the best photos online…bad lighting/weather, bad luck (e.g., don’t see the animals you were looking for), etc. In 10 days we rarely saw blue sky/the sun. The benefit of the longer days was dampened by weather making it darker than expected.
* Even though we didn’t do anything irresponsible (followed all the signs, heeded warnings, went to typical tourist spots, etc.), there is still an inherent risk to being out and about in nature. I’d say it was a positive thrilling feeling rather than truly being in danger, as long as you respect the place. But unfortunately all throughout the trip we saw people being stupid and disrespectful (e.g., getting too close to the waves breaking on the beach, climbing over ropes to get photos at the edge of cliffs, etc.) 😡 

**Must Brings**

* I’ve seen some people on here say that you don’t need waterproof clothing — good for you! While water resistant pants/windbreakers may suffice for waterfall mist/light rain, if you’re unlucky enough to get the kind of rain we had for a few days, you NEED fully waterproof gear to be able to still do things outside. A raincoat is infinitely better than a poncho, which blows around uselessly when there’s a lot of wind.
* LAYERS!!! The weather was constantly changing, so it’s better to have multiple layers than a warm weather outfit + a heavy jacket IMO. The temperature is not a good indicator of how cold it is — wind and rain can really chill you. Most days I wore a base layer (thermals/long underwear — merino wool is best) + lightweight hiking pants and a zip-up fleece. I added my rain pants and raincoat or lightweight down vest/jacket as needed. I also frequently wore a beanie, neck gaiter, and gloves. On the really windy days, my face was very red and irritated — honestly would have used a balaclava. Even on the nicer days (almost 60 and sunny), I was comfortable after stripping off layers. I never needed a t-shirt/shorts (although I saw plenty of people in those so ymmv). 
* Bright colors…I know it’s kind of a joke, but I thought the photos look nicer when we are more colorful. 
* I found packing cubes to be really helpful since we were in and out of different places every night. It made finding what I needed and unpacking/repacking very easy.
* Hiking shoes. You need strong ankle support. We didn’t even do any real hikes but just walking from the parking to most of the sites can be rocky, muddy, etc. 
* Comfy socks that won’t rub in your boots! I wore fully wool socks a few times when it was really cold (e.g., under my snorkeling gear) but mostly was very comfortable in Darn Tough lightweight hiking socks. 
* Quick drying towel if you plan to go to any pools! Loved the Youphoria one from Amazon (make sure you get the large size). It came with a washcloth which was also useful since most hotels didn’t provide. 
* Shower flip-flops if you’re staying in places with shared bathrooms. Don’t try to wear regular flip flops, they won’t dry fast enough. 
* Wet bag for bathing suits and anything else that gets wet until you can get to your accommodations and hang it up 
* Disposables are hard to come by — glad we brought a case with reusable utensils that we washed, a garbage bag to keep in the car, reusable shopping bags that fold up small, chip clips. We wish we brought ziplock bags/tupperware for leftovers. We forgot to bring a reusable mug/thermos, which was a big mistake — I got burnt after a compostable cup we were reusing fell apart, and we ended up buying a travel mug in a gift shop.
* Mosquito head net. They are only $10 and really made some of the spots more comfortable. 
* Different kinds of phone chargers/adapters! Our car only had the old USB plug-in, and our chargers are USB-C connection. We found that our phone batteries drained much faster than at home, probably due to international roaming, so being able to charge in the car was necessary. Also, the portable charger we brought is solar charging, which wasn’t great in Iceland since we rarely saw the sun 🙃
* If you have space, bring your medicine cabinet! We packed a medicine bag but still left things behind that would have been helpful. Generally when traveling I avoid bringing things that I might not use that are easy to get if needed. But over-the-counter medicines and first aid supplies are not easy to get when you’re traveling around Iceland, so I’d recommend bringing anything you can, just in case. Hopefully you won’t need any of it, but if you do, you will be happy you have it! 

**Other Tips** 

* Pay attention to gas/bathrooms on your route. There are some sparse stretches of the Ring Road. We filled up whenever we got down to 1/4 and used the toilet whenever we had the chance. Use Flush app to find bathrooms.
* Budget for parking. Most attractions now charge \~1000ISK to park. That adds up after 10 days. City street parking is paid most of the time too. I used both EasyPark and Parka apps for all the parking fees.
* The weather is really no joke. Check alerts apps (SafeTravel, Veður, Færð & Veður) multiple times per day — it can change quickly and vary greatly across the country. Our drive during the yellow alert was only doable because my partner is reasonably comfortable/experienced driving in bad conditions. If you’re not, get good insurance and be prepared to alter your plans.
* Even though I spent more to get refundable accommodations (all on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com)), there’s still a deadline. My credit card has good coverage but I’d really recommend getting additional cancel/change for any reason insurance — there’s just too much risk with the weather in Iceland.
* EVERYTHING TAKES LONGER. Especially in bad weather. Getting in and out of the car and in and out of your layers, bathroom stops (and lines!), scenic stops, lingering at a cool place, rest time, etc. I tried to pack in WAY too much! 
* I recommend booking activities first thing in the morning. No traffic, no crowds, no waiting. Gets you up and out. And less stressful than trying to make it all the way to a meeting spot in the middle of the day when you’re seeing other things too.
* I prepared and researched for so many hours and still there were things I wish I knew. If you’re really trying to pack a lot in, it’s helpful to also note how far the attraction is walking from the parking lot? Is there a place to get food there? Bathrooms? etc.
* Double check everything! I made a few mistakes, like booking a room for 1 adult when there were 2 of us (worked it out with them) and booking the completely wrong lava cave (realized too late and lost the money).

Post,August 7 day ring road trip report + tips,omatapombos,2024-08-16 19:24:37,"Hi everyone, here is my August trip report(6-13Aug), I will be happy to answer any questions.



**Weather** - We got very lucky with the weather, it was pretty much either sunny or cloudy when we were out of the car, zero rain. Some places were windy of course, but very manageable.



**Flight** - We used “Play” airline because it was the only one with direct flight from our city, overall it was a great experience, the website has a nice UI, very easy check-in process. The flight was also pleasant, seats with recline and one of them had USBs for charging. They were ahead of schedule in both flights, so they seem very efficient.



**Car Rental** - We used ZeroCar because it was the cheapest option with full coverage with a discount code that we found here in the sub. We booked a Toyota Yaris but they gave us a Kia Rio. We were disappointed because the Kia does not have lane assist and Cruise control and consumes more fuel. But the Kia overall behaved well (we did \~1800 Km at a 5.1l average) and the check in and check out process was very fast and easy, so I can highly recommend ZeroCar( gravel insurance is a must, but we were glad we went with full coverage, the piece of mind + fast check in and check out).



**Fuel**: We always fueled our Car at Órkan, since they seem to have the best gasoline prices. I registered on the website to get the Órkan Tourist Card to my Google Wallet, that also gives a discount on the fuel. Yes they place a hold on your card and then place another order to give the money back (which can be instant or take days, just be aware). 



**Payments**: Used Parka app for almost every parking (for some there is a specific website), Google wallet worked 100% for other payments. Zero cash needed.



**Itinerary**

**Day 0**

*  Arrival + car pickup.
* **Stay:** Keflavik



**Day 1**

* Groceries in Reykjavik Krónan
* Thingvellir National Park
* Laugarvatn Fontana
* Brúarárfoss (Parking)
* Geyser
* Gulfoss Falls
* Kerid Crater
* Dinner at Pylsuvagninn in Selfoss
* **Stay**: Selfoss



**Day’s comments**: Thingvellir was skippable (unless you are doing the Sifra Snorkeling), though it has some interesting rock formations. In Laugarvatn Fontana we tried the rye bread, it was delicious, you can also see for free on the right side where they bury the bread and where the hot water goes to the lake. Brúarárfoss was beautiful, but the road to parking is bad, go slow and steady with a 2WD to avoid the potholes. Pylsuvagninn in Selfoss had the best hot dog that I tried in Iceland.



**Day 2**

* Groceries in Hvolsvöllur Krónan
* Seljalandfoss + Gljufrabui
* Eyjafjallajökull Info Point
* Skógafoss
* Kvernufoss
* Dyrhólaey Lighthouse
* Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach
* Cemetery Vik (panoramic photo)
* Mid day meal at The Soup Company
* Eldhraun Lava Field parking
* Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon
* **Stay**: Hrifunes



**Day’s comments**: Be wary of people skipping the line at Gljufrabui to take photos, you have to take initiative because people will not care (bring waterproof boots, jacket and overpants) Kvernufoss was my favourite waterfall in Iceland just because of the framing and surrounding area with birds flying close by and the river leading up to it. Eyjafjallajökull Info Point is just some images of the last vulcano eruption and a cafe with some pastries and food, skippable if you don't care. We saw a lot of puffins at Dyrhólaey Lighthouse, right beside the walking trail, it was gorgeous. Soup Company’s soups were good (we ordered the “tasting menu for one” to try them all, it was good value). 



**Day 3**

* Morning 4h Glacier Adventure with LocalGuide
* Groceries at Veitingasala Restaurant, Shop, And Gas
* Svínafellsjökull Glacier
* Fjallsárlón Glacier
* Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon +  Diamond Beach
* Dinner at Otto Matur & Drykkur in Hofn
* **Stay**: Djúpivogur



**Day’s comments**: Glacier Adventure was challenging but doable (for a guy who is not used to uphill hikes) and very fun and informative. All of the Glacier stops were amazing.  Otto Matur & Drykkur’s food was good but way overpriced for the quantity. Djúpivogur was a nice small village. We tried the road to Mulagljufur Canyon’s parking but there was a dip there that seemed too steep for our 2WD vehicle.



**Day 4**

* Took the (somewhat) shitty 939 road towards Egilsstaðir
* Groceries at Bónus Egilsstaðir
* Rjúkandi Waterfall
* Stuðlagil Canyon (Parking Klaustrusel)
* Dettifoss (West Side, failed the East side. Missed Selfoss due to check-in time constraints)
* Dinner at Fish and Chips Lake Mývatn
* Hverir
* Krafla Power Plant and Vulcano
* **Stay**: Reykjahlíð



**Day’s comments:** Okay, this was the day with beautiful sights and crappy roads. The 939 road towards Egilsstaðir was very bad for our 2WD and required a lot of patience to avoid all the potholes(though the views were very nice). We would probably take the ring road instead, even if it may take a bit longer. The Stuðlagil Canyon (Parking Klaustrusel) however is perfectly doable with a standard 2WD. Yes there are potholes but they are small and easily avoidable, just go slow and steady and you will save yourself 1h round trip of walking, even though the parking is paid I think it is worth it. You definitely want to take this road because on the “main access” you can’t enter the canyon, and the Stuðlagil was my favourite thing in Iceland.

We also tried Dettifoss East road, yes we saw the “rough terrain” signs but decided to give it a shot anyway… It was the shittiest road we encountered, we lasted like 10 minutes before we decided to turn around, the risk just isn’t worth it imo. We saw some girls going like 60 Km/h on a Yaris and thought they had super powers cause they could be getting a flat tire at any moment.

Anyway, went to the west side, and Dettifoss was very mighty, Hverir and especially Krafla Volcano were also beautiful (we had both sites to ourselves past 8 pm). Don’t miss Rjúkandi on the way to the canyon, it is a pretty tall and beautiful waterfall.



**Day 5**

* Grjótagjá
* Hverfjall
* Skútustaðagígar + souvenir shopping here
* Goðafoss (East Bank Parking)
* [~Foss~](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B3BgLM1cavobwXhu6)
* Akureyri walking and eating (Pylsuvagninn á Akureyri, Moe’s Food Truck fish and chips, Kaffi Ilmur
* Fosslaug Hot spring + Reykjafoss
* **Stay**: Laugarbakki



**Day’s comments:** Skútustaðagígar can be skipped as it wasn’t really impressive and there were actually quite a few tourists. “Foss” was one of the highlights for me, the view towards Akureyri was sublime, though the water was lukewarm at best. Akureyri is a very nice city for an afternoon walk. Fosslaug Hot springs were the highlight of the day for us, we went at around 7:15 pm and he had it all to ourselves! It was very warm and we had a fantastic time.



**Day 6** 

* Grábrók
* Tried Braud and Co famous rolls (vanilla roll)
* Lunch at Messinn (Arctic Char) + Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur
* Afternoon Reykjavik Free walking Tour
* Rainbow Street
* Hallgrímskirkja
* Loki’s rye bread ice cream
* More Reykjavik walking and sightseeing
* Sky lagoon Pure at night for Sunset
* **Stay**: Reykjavik



**Day’s comments:** Grábrok, though a very sizable pair of craters, wasn’t very special in terms of beauty, so you could skip it**.** Braud and Co’s vanilla roll was good, but I think overrated? (I saw a bunch of comments telling this is the holy grail of rolls and the best they have tried, so I went with a lot of expectations and even though it was good it didn’t live up to the hype, maybe I didn’t have the freshest one, who knows). Messinn’s Arctic Char was amazing, as was Loki’s rye bread ice cream. Highly recommend the Reykjavik Free walking Tour, it is a very nice way to know about Iceland’s history and traditions. Sky Lagoon to finish up the day with the sunset was bliss.

  


**Day 7**

* Blue lagoon walking path and sneak peak
* [~Utsynisstaour lava viewpoint~](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5yonUF1Wfoz5kRA99)
* Bridge Between Continents
* Gunnuhver Hot Springs
* Fuel up and return car before afternoon flight



**Day’s comments:** The lava viewpoint was very interesting, you can take a peak at very fresh lava. We even saw some smoking in the distance. Very interesting rock formations. Bridge Between Continents has a nice framing and makes some nice photos.



P.S: *Dacia Dusters. Dacia Dusters everywhere*! In retrospective, I can definitely see why, on my next trip I will probably go with a 4X4 cause some of the gravel roads were definitely dodgy on a 2WD.

Comment,,stevenarwhals,2024-08-14 14:46:05,You can try emailing the company and asking if they would add a tour on the morning of the 21st. They’ll probably say No but it’s worth a shot. Or try to find another tour operator that’s still running then. But the tours stop running then because that’s when the puffins fly out to sea for the year.,5,

Post,Honeymoon in early September (semi-last-minute planning!),InnerProduce,2024-08-14 03:33:28,"Hi everyone!

My fiance and I were so busy planning our  wedding that our Honeymoon plans fell to the background, but now it's coming up so soon and we only have a few things booked!

We are from the US and will be spending 7 days in Iceland. We enjoy walking/casual hiking but also want to do plenty of relaxing. We don't mind long drives, and figure there will be plenty to stop and see. We are planning to focus on seeing the south coast, Westman Islands, Golden Circle, and Reykjavik. Please let me know if this itinerary makes sense! I thought it best to start farther away, then make our way back and finish in Reykjavik for the weekend as we also want to get tattoos there and enjoy some nightlife.


Monday - Arrive in KEF late evening, pick up rental car & sleep at Micro Suites (booked)

Tuesday - drive 4hrs to Kirkjubæjarklaustur, checkin at Hotel, visit Diamond Beach (not yet booked)

Wednesday - drive to Glacial Pool, maybe book zodiac boat tour

Wednesday afternoon - drive to & spend some time in Vik, then drive to Landeyjahöfn & take ferry to Vestmannaeyjar/Westman Islands

Wednesday night - hotel stay on Vestmannaeyjar (booked)

Thursday - see puffins hopefully, ferry back to Landeyjahöfn, drive to Selfoss/start golden circle

Thursday night - stay in Geysir Hotel or other along golden circle (not yet booked)

Friday - finish golden circle drive, check in to Reykjavik hotel, night out in the city (not yet booked)

Saturday - Museums, restaurants, tattoos, shops in Reykjavik

Sunday - Reykjadalur hike, fancyish dinner

Monday - sky lagoon, return car, Flight home at 8pm


Ok, I know that this is not a full itinerary! Please let me know if this makes sense and/or if you have any suggestions or tips on what to see, where to stay, etc. We haven't traveled much (I'm from northeast US, and I have only been as far as Canada) so any help is much appreciated!",1,5.0

I have checked the webcam on Borgarfjörður eystri and it seems empty right now, but maybe there are some times when they are easier to see?

We were thinking about taking the ferry to Heimaey tomorrow, but if there are fou sure not going to be any puffins there we might change our plans and check out something else, there is no lack of things to see ;)

Post,Visiting with 2 teens next week,Latter_Literature880,2024-08-13 16:43:22,"Hello! Because of poor choices made by my ex (long story) I have a last minute flight to Iceland booked for next Monday night from Chicago. I will arrive Tuesday morning.

My two teen daughters will arrive at midnight from Copenhagen. So in other words I am traveling east, but they're traveling west after a week in Sweden.

I do NOT want to rent a car. We aren't going to hard-core hike. We have to be at the airport again for the 7:30pm flight on Friday! What are your recommendations?

My thoughts: Tuesday I'll be on my own, so I can go get some groceries and do one activity. Wednesday: Hvammsik? Puffins? Thursday: this is our only full day not marred by jet lag. We will do one of the big tours ... do you have a recommendation? There are so many, I feel overwhelmed. Friday: Puffins? Secret Lagoon? Sky Lagoon?

Post,7 day Ring Road august trip report,Masculinum,2024-08-13 13:31:10,"This subreddit was invaluable during and before my trip so here's my report, hopefully it helps someone else. Often you will see people here say that a week isn't enough to do the ring road so here's my report. Personally I didn't think it was too little time, you just have to be a bit selective with attractions and you cant see everything, which is ok since Ive got an excuse to come back again.

Note that this was our 2nd trip and we skipped a couple of tourist highlights we already saw like Reynisfjara and the Golden Circle.

Rent a car - got a Kia X-ceed 2wd from Lotus, again as everyone here I recommend getting the full insurance, I got a cracked windshield from flying gravel on road 1, when I was returning the car I reported it and they just waved me away and didnt even go check on the car. 
Also, for the ring road and gravel access roads there is no need to spend more on a 4x4, it's all doable with a 2wd vehicle.

Day 1 Keflavik:

- Landed around 23:00 flight was a bit delayed, picked up the car (had to call Lotus to come pick us up).
- Spent the night in Blue Viking Guesthouse - pretty good price and decent place for a sleepover.

Day 2 KEF to Vik

-Kerid crater
- Hveragerdi thermal park (nice little park with a geyser, hot springs and a cafe, you can even boil your eggs in a hot spring)
-ate in Selfoss food hall, decent food
- Seljanandfoss and Gljufrabui, tip: climb Seljanandfoss on the left side, everyone just bunches up on the right since it's closest to the parking.
- Skogafoss - climbed the stairs and did the start of the fimmvorduhals trail up the river Skoga, beautiful, hopefully one day I'll do the whole thing
- Dryholaey - saw puffins
- Slept at Giljur Guesthouse - beautiful surroundings, decent guesthouse

Day 3 Vik to Hofn

- Ice cave tour with Gravel Travel -one of the highlights of trip. Pretty horrible weather but it kinda made it even better to have to fight the elements. Super jeep drive through the Highlands was fantastic.
-ate at Black Crust Pizza - good pizza, your toilet visits will look... interesting for the next few days.
-Fljadargljufur canyon
- Skaftafell hike to Svartifoss - a really nice wooded area, reminded me of continental Europe more than Iceland
- skipped Jokusarlon lagoon since the weather turned crap - gale winds and horizontal rain
- slept at Fosshotel Vatnajokull - a decent hotel but definitely too expensive 

Day 4 - Hofn to Borgafjordur Eystri

- came back to visit Jokusarlon lagoon and diamond beach
- visited Stokknes - probably biggest disappointment, crap access road, expensive and the weather was bad so we didn't see the mountain. I would skip this unless the weather is nice.
- Borgafjordur Eystri - the most beautiful place I've ever seen, the ride over the mountain pass is out of this world. Also tonnes of puffins.
- Slept at Blabjorg Resort - 10/10 hotel with an outdoor spa overlooking the fjord and a beer brewery next to it. I'm kinda on the fence to even write about it since they'll probably become famous and raise the prices into the sky.

Day 5 - Borgafjordur to Akureyi

- Detifoss, Hverir and that GoT cave
- Studlagil canyon, looks great, a bit crowded but not too bad
- skipped Lake Myvatn (probably should've replaced Snaefsnelles with another day in the north)
- beautiful drive through the black sand desert, stopped at Beitarhusid, felt like I was in the Restaurant at the end of the universe 
- slept in Hotel Natur Akureyi, decent hotel

Day 6 - Akureyi to Snaefsnelles 

- walked around Akureyi a bit
- Fosslaug waterfall - lovely waterfall with a hot spring bath right next to it, took a dip, was great. Entrance 10 usd/eur.
- Kolugljufur canyon - great looking canyon 
- slept in Hotel Snaefsnelles - nice hotel 

Day 7 - Snaefsnelles to Reykjavik

- I was surprised at how much stuff there was to see here in a relatively compact peninsula. Had a stop every 10 minutes. Favourites were seals at Ytri Tunga, Bjarnafoss and Raudfelsgja gorge. 
- slept at Eric the Red Guesthouse, not bad but not sure where the high rating comes from
- went for a hotdog  and beer at Lemmy's (reduced the glass size to 400 ml but the price stayed the same which I wasn't too happy about)

Day 8 - Reykjavik to Keflavik

- went to Perlan and Lava show, both great
-ate a nice and fairly affordable burger at Hagavagninn
-checked out Raudholar before we left
- returned the car, Lotus shuttled us to the airport late afternoon, until next time Iceland :)

Total cost (booking, rentacar, food, parking etc) excluding airplane tickets was about 4300 EUR for 2 people, 7 nights.

- best tip for the trip: get good waterproof boots, you will spend a lot of time in and around water.

- be careful with Google maps, sometimes they send you to some wonky gravel roads thinking they're giving you a shortcut. Oxi pass between Hofn and Egilstaddir for example.",9,9.0

Post,Accommodation Reviews & Information,ameliachester,2024-08-11 19:02:44,"I just got back from an amazing second trip to Iceland. I will eventually do a trip report, but really wanted to talk about my accommodations while the experience is still fresh. For the most part, they were amazing, and I thought my experience might be helpful for some of you.

I am in my late 40s and travelled with my partner who is in his late 50s. We had a somewhat flexible but by no means extravagant budget and we really wanted to prioritize comfort, knowing our days were bound to be exhausting. There are so many great and more affordable guesthouse options than what we chose, but we really wanted to have a private washroom in all of our accommodations and we tried to find places that included breakfast.

I started booking accommodations over a year ago, and I booked them all through Expedia. I always chose the refundable, “pay now” options, which allowed me to spread the cost of this trip over a greater period of time. For most places I was able to cancel for a full refund up until a few days before my reservation, which was super helpful as my itinerary went through several changes. I also regularly checked Expedia for better options and found that many places did become available closer to my travel dates. Because of this flexibility and because the car rental company we chose also had a very flexible refund policy, I decided against getting travel insurance (I got health insurance of course, just not trip cancellation). Next time, I will get the travel insurance regardless; Iceland weather and volcanic activity should not be taken for granted! Part of the ring road was closed due to flooding on our second day there, and it looked like it would take a while to repair, so we made the decision to forgo two of our accommodations and drive 7 hours in the opposite direction in order to reset and catch up with the rest of our itinerary. It turned out to be unnecessary, as the road was fixed later that day (Icelanders are so remarkably efficient!} but no regrets; we loved spending the extra time up north and only lost the cost of one night’s accommodation. Shout out here to **The Garage** on the south coast. I’d been so looking forward to staying there and will absolutely stay there in the future; it looks amazing! They provided a full refund even though they totally didn’t have to.

Some general notes about Iceland accommodations from a North American (Canadian) perspective: I’ve never come across a place with a bathtub; they are always showers, and the showers are often much smaller than what we’re used to. They rarely include mini-fridges or microwaves but reliably include a kettle. They’re usually twin beds pushed together or pulled apart depending on your preference. You get separate duvets for each person rather than one larger one. Breakfasts don’t usually include hot food but they are usually plentiful and delicious.

Here are descriptions of where we stayed, and the costs in Canadian $ (1 Canadian $ = about 100 isk, so easy to convert!) Note that we stayed in these places during the high tourist season, and I am sure they would be less expensive at other times of the year.

\* = Places I loved so much I wish I could have stayed for a week

**\*Farmhotel Efstidalur in Laugarvatn** (July 26-28, 2 nights) – For some reason the amount shown on my receipt is in pounds or euros, 469 total. We stayed here for one night on our last trip and loved it so much we wanted to stay again. The room had a rustic motel kind of vibe, super cute cabin-y room with a deck out front with a table and chairs. The room was a decent size though the bathroom was tiny. This would be a great place for families with young kids, and I believe they have larger cottages or rooms to accommodate families. It’s on a working farm and they make their own ice cream! I believe there was a small play structure and there is definitely a jumping pillow. We had to pay extra for breakfast ($25/person) but I believe breakfast is included if you book directly. It would be a great place to base yourself if you’re doing the Golden Circle and is practically right beside Bruarfoss. We had dinner and breakfast here and all meals were fantastic and reasonably priced for Iceland. We used this as a base for driving the northern f-road to Landmannalaugar (about 2 hrs & 15 mins away).

**Fljotsbakki Farm Hotel near Laugar** (July 28-30, 2 nights) - $563.07 total. We booked this place last minute, after learning about the southern ring road closure and deciding to change our route. It was one of the least impressive places we stayed but I’m sure our disappointment and exhaustion after having to change plans and do such an unexpectedly long drive coloured our feelings about it. It was absolutely fine. Large room, and a surprisingly (unnecessarily!) large washroom. The building looks rundown and utilitarian from the outside but totally modern on the inside. The outlets were in kind of a weird spot and not beside the bed as is sometimes the case. There were a couple of farm cats, one of whom was particularly affectionate and charming. Down a long dirt road directly across from Godafoss. The breakfast was one of the least memorable we had, but it was included. Good base for the Diamond Circle. There are no meals other than breakfast available.

**\*Hotel Eyvindara in Egilsstadir** (July 30 – Aug 1, 2 nights) - $706.06 total. I loved this place so much! Another motel type room with a private sitting area outside, in an actual Icelandic FOREST. There are two outdoor hot tubs on site and we had the area to ourselves the evening we arrived. The breakfast was amazing, and included, but no other meals are offered on site. It’s just a 5 minute drive outside of Egilsstadur though, and lots of restaurants there. The staff was so friendly and wonderful. Good sized room with tiny washroom. This property also has a bunch of adorable wooden cabins. We used it as a base for visiting Studagil Canyon and the nearby town of Seydisfjordur.

**\*Blabjorg Resort in Borgarfjordar Eystri** (\*\*Aug 1 – 3, 2 nights) – Receipt shows $79,974 ISK or about $800 Canadian total. This place came highly recommended here on reddit and was one of the first places I booked, as our big splurge timed for halfway through our trip when I felt we’d need some relaxing downtime. We booked the studio apartment, but there are also more affordable guestrooms available, as well as larger apartments to accommodate larger groups. A family could easily have stayed in our studio apartment. In addition to the INCREDIBLY comfortable bed in a nook behind the kitchen, there is a pull out sofa. There was a full kitchen including a dishwasher and WASHING MACHINE. But note: clothes dryers are NOT a thing in Iceland. It was hard to find space to properly dry all our clothes and in fact we had to carry on with some still damp clothes.  Large screen television as well as an amazing deck with lots of seating, looking out onto the ocean and the mountains beyond. Perfect view. As it happened, my partner came down with a cold, and we had the worst weather day of our trip; it stormed all day the full day we were there. So we just hunkered down indoors and rested and watched movies and made soup for lunch and did laundry. There is a great looking spa here as well, for an additional cost, but not feeling well, and given the weather, we decided that spending time in outdoor hot tubs would be a poor decision. The breakfast was one of the best we had. In addition to all the typically delicious freshly baked breads and croissants (these croissants were particularly amazing) and skyr, etc., they had very tasty sausages! They have a full restaurant, and their burgers are delicious. 10 minute drive from the best puffin viewing spot in Iceland, 2 minute drive from one of the best fish soups in Iceland. Wish we could have enjoyed all the great hiking in the area as well, but I suspect we will be back!

**Husavik Cape Hotel in Husavik** (Aug 3 – 4, 1 night) - $361.35. We were kind of excited to learn that this hotel was attached to the Eurovision / Story of Fire Saga exhibition and the JaJa Ding Dong bar, which guests of the hotel can access for free. It was a fun experience. It’s located just on the edge of town and very close to GeoSea. There were super tasty chocolate bars on our pillows! The beds were not super comfortable but they were fine, and the included breakfast was also kind of underwhelming. The rooms themselves were a fine size. I believe there were also more affordable guestrooms with shared washrooms.

**Hotel Varmahild in Varmahild** (Aug 4-5, 1 night) - $320.98. This place was booked kind of last minute, as our long drive at the beginning of our trip made us realize we should rethink our driving times a bit as we neared the Westfjords. This was just a place to rest our heads between things, but we were pleasantly surprised. It felt more like a typical North American hotel, like a Holiday Inn or something. We had to take an elevator! It was right off the ring road. Small room and washroom but very functional and comfortable and clean. The included breakfast was great.

**Holmavik Guesthouse in Holmavik** ( Aug 5 – 6, 1 night) - $273.09. This place was also booked pretty last minute, and there weren’t a lot of options in the area. The room was non-refundable, which made me nervous, but we made it! It was a totally cute room with a nice harbour view, and a better size than the Expedia reviews had led me to believe (though still quite small). There is a restaurant upstairs, but we only made use of it for the included breakfast which I’m sad to say was by far the worst of our trip. Nothing freshly baked, and the limited foods on offer weren’t replenished. I believe there are more affordable rooms available with shared washrooms. Holmavik is a pretty small village, and this is still not a bad option of the few that exist.

**\*Hotel Isafjordur Horn in Isafjordur** (Aug 6-7) - $364.64. This place was awesome. In a building downtown, and we got to take one of those old freight elevators up to our completely amazing, spacious room (with a completely amazing, spacious washroom). Total boutique hotel vibes, modern and comfortable and clean. There’s a common area outside with couches and a computer for folks to access. Very beautifully designed. We had to get our key from Hotel Isafjordur, which is in another building down the street, and where we also ate our included breakfast, which was one of the best breakfasts we had. Isafjordur is a very cool town and it was great to be right in the centre of it.

**Fosshotel Stykkisholmur in Stykkisholmer** (Aug 7-8, 1 night) - $401.79. We stayed in a Fosshotel so you don’t have to. This was a last minute booking, after we decided to take the ferry instead of doing the much longer scary drive back through the Westfjords. There weren’t a lot of choices. We spent our last trip joking about the opulence of the foss hotels and then ended up in one ourselves only to find that it was just like a very dated, uninspired, very expensive Holiday Inn. The view was great, though! And it was clean and comfortable and situated very close to the ferry in a pretty cool town. Breakfast wasn’t included in our Expedia booking but we decided to pay the extra $62 for the two of us to have the whole fosshotel experience. It was a very good breakfast, but we have had equally very good breakfasts elsewhere that were actually included.

**\*Fossatun Country Hotel outside of Borgarnes** (Aug 8-9, 1 night) - $265.07. We stayed in another motel kind of place, with our own deck with chairs out front. It was a very large room with a good-sized washroom. There was camping here as well and cute looking bunkies with shared washroom and kitchen facilities that I am sure were great. This place would be absolutely amazing for kids. There are a number of trails on the property including a troll trail, as well as a bunch of troll games. There was a cool looking adventure playground and three hot tubs that were very popular. Additionally, there’s a good restaurant on site, called the Rock n’ Troll Café, which has a huge selection of vinyl and great views of a beautiful waterfall. The included breakfast was one of the best we had; it even included salmon! We ate dinner there as well, and it was also good and reasonably priced.

**Reykjavik Lights by KeaHotels in Reykjavik** (Aug 9-10, 1 night) - $359.29. We had stayed in a couple of Keahotels on our last trip and trusted the brand. They have reliably great included breakfasts and rooms. This hotel was a bit out of town in a more suburban part of Reykjavik but still fairly central and a short drive away. The room was on the small side but the bed was super comfortable and it was well designed and cozy. It felt like we were in an Ikea showroom!",18,4.0

Comment,,AileenNoyle,2024-08-11 10:04:29,"With this little time available, best would be to end Monday in an hotel in the Selfoss-Fludir-Hella area, then on Tuesday you could drive up to Vik with some sights in between. 

Wednesday you could drive back to Reykjavik with a potential ferry trip.

Post,My travel plans last week (Jul 29 - Aug 4),sleepdeprivedracooni,2024-08-07 14:17:12,"I think I did less compared to some people here, but here's my trip to Iceland:

# Day 1: Arrival

Landed late morning and luckily got to check into my hostel early (thanks to a super kind receptionist). After a short rest (24 hours of being awake is no joke), I wandered around Reykjavik. Ended the day at the Perlan Museum, which was amazing and kept me busy for about three hours.

# Day 2: Lava Field Hike

Started slow, grabbed snacks and lunch from a supermarket, and met my guide at 11 for a hike along the lava fields in the Reykjanes Peninsula. We stopped at Seltún, which was cool (and a bit stinky) since I'd never seen geothermal pools before. The hike itself was around 5-6 hours with breathtaking views and a lunch stop along the way.

# Day 3: Joining the WeRoad Group

I signed up for a WeRoad trip that started in the evening. Checked out of my hostel and met a few group members for a packed lunch and coastal walk. We waited for the other members to check-in. After checking into our new hostel, we headed back to Reykjavik for dinner and drinks.

Day 4 - Golden Circle Adventures

Started early and first stop was Þingvellir National Park, the most crowded spot I visited but still stunning. Next, we saw the milky blue waters of Brúarfoss—absolutely fairy-tale-like. Then, we went to the Geysir, watching it erupt a few times before climbing up to see more geothermal pools. Gullfoss Falls was massive and soaked us, but we came prepared. Ended the day at the Blue Lagoon for a relaxing soak until closing, then back to the hostel for drinks and sleep.

Day 5: Lava Tunnels and Waterfalls

Another early start for a 9 AM tour of Raufarhólshellir Lava Tunnel—cold but so cool!  There's huge chunks of ice in some parts of the tunnel still!  Next, we visited Seljalandsfoss and its ""hidden"" waterfall behind rocky walls—amazing (Seriously guys, just don't look at the big waterfall and then go back... walk along the path until you reach a decent sized stream)! Skógafoss was another massive waterfall with a pathway all the way to the top. Dyrhólaey had stormy weather pushing us around, and we couldn’t even get out at the black beach due to high winds. Had an early dinner at Valhalla, a Viking-themed restaurant with great burgers. The restaurant also has a small Viking exhibition. Finished the day at Kerið Crater and relaxed there for a while because it was peaceful and we were the only ones there. We then headed back to the hostel to play some board games and uno.

# Day 6 - Snæfellsnes Peninsula

Long drive to Snæfellsnes with beautiful scenery. Admired Kirkjufell from the ground because we lacked the experience and the stamina to hike after 2 days of a lot of walking and jumping around. So we chilled by the waterfall near it. On the way, we also stopped at another waterfall but I forgot it's name. It was beautiful too and you could hike from the top of the waterfall all the way to the bottom where it met the large river. We then headed to Svörtuloft Lighthouse, stopping by a tiny beach for some sea breeze and quiet. . The lighthouse offered views of a glacier on one side and the sea on the other—unreal. Spent quiet some time at Arnarstapi, then visited the black church. Finally, we drove to Hvammsvík hot springs, which felt much more natural than the Blue Lagoon. The cold plunge in the sea and then back in the hot spring was such a refreshing feeling.  Even saw two puffins (no for real, even we could not believe it) fishing nearby! Content, we drove all the way back to Reykjavik for a late dinner at the hot dog stand! Some enjoyed it so much that they went for a 3rd one.

# Day 7 - Departure

Most of the group left early, but my flight was in the evening. Spent the day browsing stores, bought postcards, and got a hilarious book on elves by Rán Flygenring and Hjörleifur Hjartarson—highly recommend. Visited the Lava Show by the harbor (it was so freaking cool!), then the flea market, where I picked up jewelry, obsidian, and bookmarks. Headed to the airport afterward.

# Some Tips:

* **Public transport**: Use the Klappid app since buses only accept cash.
* **Layers**: Seriously, layers are essential.
* **Lagoon showers**: You don't have to stress about showering naked (not that I mind being naked among other women); plenty of people used private rooms and kept swimsuits on while showering before entering the lagoon or the hot spring. I know this subreddit likes to point that out excessively but the staff weren't bothered at all. Just dry off before heading to the locker rooms because that is the part they are more worried about.
* **Moss**: Avoid stepping on the moss. It’s protected because it takes ages to grow in Iceland. Respect the signs and stay on the paths. So many people kept stepping and stomping on the moss as shortcuts and it really annoyed me.

Iceland was magical and unforgettable, even if I didn’t do as much as some others. Can’t wait to go back! If anyone would like to see photos from any of these places, let me know.",2,7.0
Post,Trip Report - Ring Road,burtmacklin1236,2024-08-07 02:45:44,"Summary of our Ring Road Trip! Found a lot of great tips here so thought we'd share.

Day 1

* Breakfast at Brauð & Co - cinnamon rolls were great; lines made it chaotic
* Lunch at Brikk Bakery - great lunch
* Hallgrimskirka Church - definitely go up the tower for the views
* Sun Voyager sculpture - can park right next to it
* Harpa Concert Hall - parking garage underground; in addition from viewing from the outside, make sure you go inside and walk around
* Dinner at Posthus Food Hall - crowded AF but great variety of food
* Stayed overnight in Reykjavík

Day 2

* Did Rick Steve’s walking tour of downtown Reykjavík
* Walked up and down Laugavegur (shopping street) and Skolavordustigur (shopping street with rainbow design)
* Lunch at Posthus Food Hall again
* Sky Lagoon in the afternoon - we thought this was just ok and this was the least favorite of the three hot springs we did; the water was tepid; the views were nice; some of the staff were really friendly and some were snobby/rude; it also felt really crowded as it's not very big
* Dinner at some Asian restaurant
* Stayed overnight in Reykjavík

Day 3

* Snaefellsnes Peninsula
* Drove through Berserkjahraun Lava Field - there were only 1 or 2 scenic viewpoint pullouts; wish there were more
* Kirkjufellfoss (Game of Thrones mountain) - parked and walked less than 5 minutes to the view of the mountain, river, and falls
* Olafsvik - quick stop for view of mountains and church
* Lunch at Café Gilbakki - really simple but good lunch
* Hellissandur - drove around to see street art murals
* Djupalonssandur black sand beach
* Hellnar – walked around to see basalt formations with sea birds
* Raudfeldsgja Gorge - parked and walked up a bit to see it; definitely park and get out to see it; seeing it from the road doesn't do it justice
* Dinner at Hotel Budir - food was good but this was the biggest ripoff of a meal on the entire trip; way too overpriced (more than NY/Chicago/LA) and really tiny portions
* Stayed overnight in Budir

Day 4

* Finished driving Snaefellsnes Peninsula
* Búðakirkja – Black Church
* Ytri-Tunga Beach - easy paved walk to the beach from parking lot; have to climb down rocks to see seals
* Lunch at the Settlement Center Restaurant in Borgarnes Glaumbær Farm & Museum - great vegetarian buffet
* Dinner at Sauðá in Sauðárkrókur - good variety on menu and good food; really limited restaurants in this area
* Stayed overnight in Hofsstaðir - great place to see midnight sun because you are so far up north

Day 5

* Troll Peninsula
* Blue Church in Hofsós
* Siglufjörður - beautiful city at the top of the Troll Peninsula; visited Siglo Hotel; walked along harbor front
* Héðinsfjörður - walked around lake area between two long tunnels
* Lunch at Ketilkaffi (at art museum café) in Akureyri - good healthy lunch
* Akureyri - walked around downtown
* Godafoss
* Dinner at Fosshotel Myvatn - big portions and good food
* Stayed overnight in Myvatn

Day 6

* Spent time in Myvatn area - rained the whole day so outdoor time was limited
* Dimmuborgir Lava Formations - walked around some of the trails; all paved and really easy to walk
* Hverfjall Crater - only saw from car; raining too hard to walk up
* Krafla Geothermal Power Plant - it snowed up here but interesting exhibit/film on geothermal energy; cool to see plant from the outside
* Lunch at café at Dimmuborgir Lava Formations - good soup buffet
* Myvatn Nature Baths - awesome hot springs; locker rooms are really crowded but the baths themselves are huge and never felt crowded
* Ice Cream at Skútaís - amazing
* Dinner at Fosshotel Myvatn
* Stayed overnight in Myvatn

Day 7

* Drive to East Iceland
* Namafjall Geothermal Area - saw this on a really sunny and clear day and glad we waited to see this in the sun - the colors were vibrant
* Detifoss waterfall - we thought this was just ok; you can only see part of the waterfall from different viewpoints; it's not as scenic as some of the  waterfalls on the South Coast; the path to the waterfall was very rocky and muddy
* Lunch at Beitarhúsið Café on Ring Road - best vegan soup of the entire trip
* Dinner at Fosshotel Eastfjords - good food and big portions
* Stayed overnight in Fáskrúðsfjörður

Day 8

* Drove to Southeast coast
* Coffee/tea break in Djúpivogur
* Lunch at Kaffi Hornid in Hofn - good, solid option for lunch
* Amphibian Boat Tour at Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon - amazing; we did this when it was cloudy which makes the ice appear bluer (see note on Day 9)
* Dinner at Hotel Smyrlabjorg Restaurant (10 mins from our hotel) - good and simple food
* Stayed overnight in Skálafell - we picked this for location as there are slim pickings in the area

Day 9

* Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon - it was sunny today so we decided to go back and just walk around; it was beautiful in the sun but the ice didn't appear as blue as the day earlier when it was cloudy
* Diamond Beach
* Fjallsarlon Glacier Lagoon - walked around; you feel closer to the actual glacier but we thought Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon was prettier
* Lunch at Systrakaffi in Kirkjubaejarklaustur - great soup and risotto
* Fjaorargljufur - we just viewed this from the bridge which is a less then 5 minute walk from the parking lot; the views from here were great so we didn't walk up the trail to the top
* Víkurfjara Black Sand Beach
* Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach and basalt columns - as everyone has said the waves are really powerful so be careful; people were really close to getting swept under
* Skogafoss waterfall
* Dinner at Hotel Ranga - really good food
* Stayed overnight in Hella

Day 10

* Westman Islands
* Took 10:00 am ferry from Landeyjahöfn to Vestmannaeyjar – arrived at 10:40 am; the boarding process for driving onto the ferry is chaotic and takes forever but there are enough spots for all the cars; but be careful as when you park there is almost no room for the passenger side to get out of the car; on the way back, we had two of us sitting on our passenger side walk off instead of trying to cram in and then they just got in the car in the parking lot
* Drove scenic route around Heimaey Island
* Herjolfsdalur
* Storhofdi - really unique experience; saw puffin colony here and just watched at them for a long time
* Lunch at Tanginn - really good find on the island
* Walked around town center
* Took 4:00 pm ferry back to mainland – arrived at 4:40 pm
* Seljalandsfoss waterfall
* Dinner at the Old Dairy Food Hall - so much variety of food and really crowded; but really good
* Stayed overnight in Selfoss

Day 11

*  Golden Circle
* Thingvellir - had to park in overflow parking lot; walked the trail for about 1 hour and then turned around
* Lunch at Friðheimar - all reservations for the main restaurant were full online; but we showed up and went to the wine bar area (the more casual restaurant) in the back and got a table right away; the tomato soup was good but not life changing
* Geothermal bread tour at Fontana Thermal Baths - so cool and bread was delicious
* Gullfoss waterfall
* Geysir and Strokkur
* Dinner at Posthus Food Hall - even more crowded than the beginning of our trip but still good
* Stayed overnight in Reykjavík

Day 12

* Relaxed in Reykjavík
* Lunch at Sandholt - sooo good
* Blue Lagoon in afternoon - must do; crowded in the check in area/cafe but once you get in the lagoon, it never felt crowded and there was plenty of space; we didn't get all the people online who thought it was overrated - it was really fun and the water was really hot
* Dinner at Antons Mamma Mia in Keflavik - decent pizza
* Stayed overnight at airport hotel for morning and afternoon flights the next day

Post,Budget trip from the capital,Icy_Interview_6733,2024-08-06 23:59:45,"Hello! I’m booking a last minute trip to Iceland for next week! Me my girlfriend and a friend are going. I’m very excited. I’m wondering if anyone has input on budget friendly activities that we could do, I think we will be based out of the capital, we will visit for 4 days. We plan on renting a car, and staying in an apartment with a kitchen.

We love outdoor activities, hiking and swimming. We definitely want to check out some hot springs but I’ve been reading that they are expensive.

My girlfriend really wants to see puffins, and my friend wants to see the Icelandic horses (?)",0,7.0
Comment,,BionicGreek,2024-08-07 01:05:16,"If you’re renting a car I’d do a multi stop road trip rather than waste time staying in the capital. Book a farm cart ride to see the puffins on the south coast - Ingoldshodhi -otherwise you’re very far away from the better spots. Go from RJK - Vik - Jokulsarlon and then repeat backwards is what I’d recommend. 

Iceland and budget friendly do not mix I’m afraid however.",3,
Comment,,AlaskaGreenTDI,2024-08-07 00:41:17,The horses are everywhere. The best place to see the puffins you probably don’t have time to get to. Other than that hike your brains out and eat as many hot dogs as you can stand.,2,
Comment,,openwheelr,2024-08-07 02:37:55,"If you have a kitchen, stop at Costco and Bonus and plan to eat in. That alone will save you money. 

I was there two weeks ago. You have time to hit the Golden Circle must-see spots. Horses are all over but puffins will be tough. It's a long day, but you could take the Westman Islands ferry to see puffins. They were plentiful when we went but they will be migrating out to sea soon.

We are on a 14 day Iceland ring road trip. Our priority would be to see unique landscapes of Iceland. Does Westman Island make sense only for the elephant rock formation, and  the island view from hill? Especially in late September the puffins won't be there if I understand correctly ",4,8.0
Post,What clothing store is this??,MaroonSailboat,2024-08-03 19:32:44,"Hi everyone,

I spent two weeks in Iceland in july and had a great time! The last day we walked through the streets of Reykjavik, and I saw this top in a store window. I went in the store and tried it on, but they didn't have my size, so I ended up leaving with nothing. I'm still thinking about this top and the store a week later though, and I can't for the life of me locate it!

It had a goth/emo/rock vibe to it, like very alternative. It reminds me of Ragnaråkk in Trondheim, if anyone's familiar with that. It was somewhere in downtown Reykjavik, close to the touristy streets with all the puffin shops. I just don't remember exactly where, so I can't find it on Google Maps, and since I didn't buy anything, I only have this one picture to go off.

I'd appreciate any clues of which store this is, or if someone is even able to recognize the brand of the shirt. Thanks!",36,14.0
Post,What should I do in Vik under these…conditions?,KaleMunoz,2024-08-03 15:19:50,Black sand beach was great. I guess the weather scared off the puffins.

Comment,,AlaskaGreenTDI,2024-08-03 00:59:34,"There are plenty of warning signs about the sneaker waves, but the only safeguard is you take responsibility and heed the warnings and not do something stupid. It’s not like there’s a fence or someone there to scold you and chase you back. There is a big map with different zones and there will be a sign with the associated risk level for that day. But pushing the sneaker boundary isn’t going to give anyone extra puffin access, all the more reason to not push the wave guidelines. Also watch some sneaker wave YouTube if you want more reasons not to risk it.",6,

Post,Trip recap. 8 days in July with three young children. ,q_lee,2024-07-30 00:15:08,"Thanks to everyone on this sub who helped me plan this amazing trip. We traveled to Iceland from July 8-16 with our three daughters (9, 7, 4). We didn't get to do much hiking but did our best to explore as many of the sights as possible. Aside from this sub, we watched a lot of YouTube videos to help us prepare. We found the videos from Iceland with a View and Wake Up Reykvavík the most helpful. Here was our itinerary: 

Day 1: Landed at KEF around 7:30 AM. Little to no sleep on the plane from the US. Made it to Reykjavík via Flybus by 9:30. Stored luggage at BSI lockers. Reykjavík Roasters for coffee and breakfast. Walked to Perlan and spent about 2.5 hours exploring (small snooze during the aurora video). Nauthóll for lunch (pricey but very good). Back to BSI to get luggage and then to our Airbnb on Laugavegur. Went to a few stores, hit up Bónus and went back to the apartment to crash. 

Day 2: Brauð & Co for cinnamon rolls, Reykjavík Roasters, Hallgrimskirkja then shopping down the rainbow road. Vikinga Pylsur for lunch. Rye bread ice cream at Cafe Loki. National Museum of Iceland. Dinner at Svarta Kaffið (bread bowl soups).

Day 3: Picked up Blue Car rental (used Hopp scooters to get to and from rental office). Hveragerði Geothermal Park where we boiled eggs and ate with rye bread. Raufarhólshellir lava tunnel tour (highly recommended). Selfoss for lunch at the Old Dairy Food Hall. Seljalandsfoss and Gljufrabui. There was a long line to go inside Gljufrabui and people were trying to cut and getting in arguments which took away from the beauty of it all. Faxi bakery (skyr brownies almost put me in a coma) then Skógafoss. We had planned to hike to see a few of the waterfalls upstream of Skógafoss but it was starting to rain heavily, so we decided to keep heading south to Dyrhólaey and Reynisfjara. Then, back to Reykjavík, gas station hotdogs on the way. 

Day 4: Berry-filled cinnamon rolls from Emilie and the Cool Kids, then left Reykjavík for the Golden Circle. First stop was Kerid Crater. Friðheimar for an early lunch of tomato soup inside the greenhouse (such a cool experience). Faxafoss, Geysir, Gullfoss (crowded, but it's a must-see). Efstidalur II for ice cream, then onto þingvellir which we explored for a while. Continued on to our Airbnb on a sheep farm in Borgarnes. Lamb shank dinner at Englendingavík which was perfect after a long, cold day (they also had a fish buffet that looked amazing). 

Day 5: Driving to Húsavík. Stopped in Akureyri on the way and spent about 3 hours exploring the town. Took the long way and avoided the tunnel after Akureyri. The view along that route was so beautiful and well worth the extra 10 minutes of your life. Stopped at Goðafoss on the way to Húsavík. The kids discovered their first jumping balloon and couldn't get enough of it. 

Day 6: Whale and puffin tour with North Sailing. Saw lots of puffins, seals, and two humpback whales. The tour had been delayed so we had a late start on our longest drive of the trip. Drove all the way back to Hellissandur. Gas station dinner from an Orkan in Akureyri (surprisingly delicious lamb sub for me). Weather turned ugly when we got into Snæfellsnes. Almost no visibility driving around the mountain. Arrived at our really cool oceanside Airbnb in Hellisandur around 10 PM. 

Day 7: Exploring Snæfellsnes. This was something I was really looking forward to, but the weather did not cooperate and there was very low visibility due to fog. Snæfellsjökull was sadly not visible. We hit Saxhóll Crater, Hólahólar, Lóndrangar, Fjöruhúsið café (my favorite stop of the day), and the Arnarstapi area. Had to skip Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge due to the weather. Went to Ytri Tunga, saw one seal and what was left of the whale skeleton (not much). Circled back to see Kirkjufell, but it wasn't visible in the fog. Plokkfiskur lunch at Harbour Cafe in Grundorfjörður. Back to Reykjavík.

Day 8: Final day in Reykjavík. Sunny and beautiful. Airbnb in city centre. Baka Baka for chocolate croissants. Whales of Iceland, which everyone loved. Omnom for ice cream and chocolate. Climbed up Þúfa. Took it easy and walked around the city, grazing on whatever looked good. 

Day 9: Up early, walked to BSI to catch the 5:30 AM bus to KEF. Kids all cried and wanted to stay forever. Finally got to see Snæfellsjökull from the plane. 

Takk fyrir, Iceland! We have so much left to explore. ",69,21.0

Post,Our 7-day itinerary ,False-Public-3289,2024-07-29 06:12:12," Mid July 2024 (post vacation)

———-

Day 1:
1. Arrival - sleep well in plane, so you have a good start on first day, 
2. pickup car rental. Don’t forget mobile wifi
3. Blue lagoon if you want - none of us are into it, so figured it’s waste of money and especially time. 
4. Roads closures near grindavik due to lava flows, so we took detour via route 43. 
5. Drive to Fagradalsfjall volcano (active) to look at recent lava fields. 
6. Seltun geothermal area
7. Quick stop Krýsuvíkurkirkja church
8. Fagradalsfjall volcano (active) and take a short hike to recently solidified, but still hot lava field. 
9. Shop for bread, snacks etc at bonus or Kronon gorcery stores at Rekjyavik
10. Drive to Thingvellir park, oxrarfoss waterfall and hike along fault zone (note: most people do this as part of golden circle)
11. Reykjavik downtown - Hallgrimskirkja cathedral (park here), walk around Rainbow street, Sun Voyager sculpture, concert hall etc. 
12. Stay in Reykjavik

Day 2:
1. Golden Circle north of selfoss 
2. Kerid crater
3. Skalholt church 
4. Geysir 
5. Gullfoss 
6. Hveradalir Thermal Area (gravel road if min 3hrs to spare and a 4 x 4) - we couldn’t do it.
7. Hjalpaefoss on the way to haifoss. 
8. Haifoss (about 10km on bad gravel road). It’s quite far, but we felt the view may be worth it. 
9. Gjain if time permits, it’s near haifoss
10. Drive back, maps pointed us to take gravel road 26, but it was bad, so we took a longer paved road. 
11. Stay in Hella (we tried in Vik, but couldn’t find any)

Day 3:
1. Seljalandsfoss
2. Skógafoss waterfall and Stainbogafoss, which is up the hill with about 500 steps and a short hike. There are several more waterfalls up the hill along the same path. We didn’t want to do, but many people do. 
3. Sólheimajökull Glacier.  Walk close to glacier if you can, further from observation deck. 
4. dyrholaey black beach & lighthouse 
5. reynisfjara black sand beach (famous) - you can spot puffins on the cliffs. We had binoculars, so it was nice. 
6. Vicarfjara black beach & Vik church - we only went to the church from the you could see the vik beach. 
7. Yoda cave at Viking beach 
8. Fjadrargljufur canyon - its 30min hike and a waterfall at the 3rd observation deck. 
9. Maelifel - if you have 4 x4 and at least 3 hrs to spare. We couldn’t. 
10. Stay in Hella

Day 4: 
1. Glacier Lagoon - 1hr zodiac tour, book in advance. You can spot seals, lots of birds catching fish etc. 
2. Diamond beach - only west parking lot. East side may not have ice at all. 
3. Útsýni yfir jökul glacier (Crawfoot), it’s just west of glacier lagoon. This glacier also has a smaller lagoon. 
4. Several other glaciers view points
5. Svartifoss ( 3km or 1hr hike each way)
6. Eldhraun Lava Field view 
7. Mulagljufur Canyon 
8. Stay in Hella (couldn’t find accommodation near Hofn)

Day 5: 
1. Cover any spots not covered earlier especially on the way. We covered waterfalls (ex: svertifoss) canyon and several glaciers that from previous days itineraries as we couldn’t earlier. 
2. Quick glacier stops at Lómagnúpur Scenic Spot, Skeiðarársandur and Haoldukvisl (look at 20km long glacier and delta), and 3 glacier view from parking spot a little further east. 
3. Stokksnes/Vestrahorn mountain, very beautiful, a must if you can. $10/pp fee. We even spotted a mink whale, which was unexpected. 
4. Stops at places for pictures if you want. We saw bunch of swans and got a second whale spotting as well. 
5. Google directions asked us to take gravel roads, but we weren’t comfortable especially in the night, so opted to stay on ring road only even though its a bit longer. 
6. Night time driving along fjords could be challenging due to fog. 
7. Stay in Seydisfjordur -  it’s a beautiful short drive from Egilsstaðir along route 93 over mountain pass. 

Day 6:
1. North coast long drive - split into 2 days if don’t want to drive whole day.
2. Gufu waterfall quick stop on 93. 
3. Heavier mountain at highest point of mountain pass on route 93. 
4. Stuðlafoss (gravel road, but not bad), we went to west parking lot observation deck as we didn’t have time. East parking lot with 3km hike to bottom of the canyon could offer better views. 
5. Dettifoss/selfoss - use west parking lot as it’s fully paved. 1km easy hike. 
6. Hverir/Myvatn geothermal area
7. Goðafoss - use west parking for a better view. 
8. Koluglijufur Canyon (we didn’t go)
9. Kirkjufell - arrow head mountain and nice falls - out of way and min 4hrs to spare. We wanted go, but ran out of time. 
10. Stops at scenic spots and notice varying landscape deep valleys with snow capped mountains (felt like we were in alps), forests, lava fields and lakes. 
11. Grabok volcano - quick stop. 
12. Stay in Reykjavik. relax and fly back next day. 

Tips: 
1. Best to rent an SUV, preferably 4 X 4 or at least AWD SUV and look for automatic transmission. Max speed on paved roads is 90km/hr. Unpaved or gravel roads (F roads) are bumpy and slow and not preferred without 4 X 4. We rented AWD SUV. 
2. Rent mobile wifi either with car rental or separately. It’s just $12/day (4g is enough) for unlimited use and can connect multiple devices and we even took it with us on hikes as well. International roaming is spotty and offline maps aren’t great. In car navigation can be confusing. Google maps with car play works great! Thank me later! 
3. Book hotels and glacier lagoon tour well in advance esp for family. Vik is central location for most attractions in the south. We stayed in Hella as we booked pretty late and it was only decent family accommodation we could find for our dates. Other good locations for stay are Selfos, Hofn, Egilsstaðir/Seyðisfjörður or Akureyri for driving around ring road. 
4. Cards need chip. Credit cards worked big towns, but forced to use debit card with PIN for gas in rural areas. Cash advance pin for credit cards didn’t work for me. 
5. Many gas stations put around $150 to $200 hold (pending charge) on credit card in additional actual charge. Some gas stations allow to fill gas for specific max amount (ex: 12000 Kronos) and filling up less is ok - no hold in this case. 
6. Keep gas more than 1/2 tank full all times as gas stations in rural areas are sparse. 
7. Carry universal adapters (to charge in hotels) and 12V lighter adapter with usb ports for the car. 
8. Eye patches for sleep as it never gets dark in summer and some hotels or hostels might not have dark curtains. 
9. Good to carry basic medications for cold, fever, headache etc.
10. Carry reusable water bottles and fill up water. Tap water in Iceland is clean and no need to buy bottled.  
11. Late winter to early spring clothing - summer highs will be in 50s and wind chill with rain/water can be cold. Good to take water resistant jackets as rain is expected. If you would like to use hot tubs or sauna at hotels, carry swim wear.  
12. Pay attention to google maps directions as it can direct to us to unpaved roads, which are slow and bumpy. We used paved roads as much as possible. 
13. Map out all the locations in google maps ahead of the trip including hotels. You can add/remove locations as needed. 
14. Plan out itinerary for each day ahead and try to stick to it as much as possible. Leave some buffer as we often stop at random scenic spots or cover locations that we couldn’t earlier etc. 
15. Use full day light to maximize site seeing. We were on road 14hrs every day and visited places even at midnight. 
16. Food can be expensive and most places outside of capital close by 8pm. Buy snacks at Bonus or similar Kronan. We often preferred to pick up fast food at convenient stores at esp. at gas stations. Look and plan out food in advance to avoid going to bed hungry. Also, if your hotel includes breakfast, fill up before you start. 
17. Night time driving near fjords, valleys or water bodies around south-east or north-west side can be super foggy and challenging. 
18. Wild life - sheep (everywhere), horses, cattle, Puffins (Vik beaches, Hofn area), seals (glaciar lagoon), swans (south east), mink whales (south east). We had binoculars. ",5,7.0
Post,The ugliest part of iceland,Hodltiltheend,2024-07-28 23:38:25,"Ive been here now for 8 days out of my 14 day trip here. Weve completed the ring road (went off the road to travel through the northwest fjords) and have seen so many beautiful things this trip. Everywhere i looked there has been so much beauty in nature and civilization .  whether it be the rock formations, seeing the puffins and the foxes, or even these wonderful buildings with the beautiful colors here ive been so grateful to be here and see everything ive seen. 
The ugliest thing though, is the trash. I always bring a bag with me to pick up trash whenever i go hiking where im from in the US because theres always garbage to be picked up, especially on the beaches. But im so surprised about how much trash ive seen here on the trails, and campsites,by inconsiderate people. I get that not all of it is on purpose, but when you have cans and bottles and snack bags and literal bags of rotting food and waste left on the side of the highway and trails its kinda nuts to think that people did this on purpose with no consideration to Icelands residents and its animal population.
 The past 8 days ive picked up a lot of trash here, so just please everyone, try to be mindful of where you put stuff and when you take things out of your pockets so they dont fly off. Gata try and keep it beautiful for everyone, even if they dont think the same way.

Post,South Coast - driving between black sand beaches around Vik (& too ambitious of a day?),zoddie2,2024-07-26 17:35:12,"Hi everyone - I'm planning a too-ambitious day in August that starts near Selfoss (Selfoss airbnb->Seljalandsfoss and Gljufrabui Waterfalls->Skógafoss -> Kvernufoss -> Sólheimajökull glacier? -> Skógar Museum? -> Dyrhólaey Lighthouse -> Reynisfjara Beach ->Lava show in Vik -> Víkurfjara Black Sand Beach...plus lunch in there somewhere) and ends up in Vik (before we drive back to eat at the Ingólfsskáli Viking Restaurant).

In my research, it seems like seeing the Dyrhólaey Lighthouse area (puffins, views), Reynisfjara Beach (basalt columns), and Víkurfjara Black Sand Beach (we may go to Vik anyway for the Lava Show) are all worth seeing.  There doesn't seem to be direct access between them, according to Google Maps.  Is that true or are there smaller roads, closer to the water that could cut down on the 35 minute drive time between the three?  

And, if we run out of time, which should we prioritize seeing?  We'll have a big group (aged 6 - 71) and two cars.

Here's the Google maps link:

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/cZznXXYJ5nwqYisa9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cZznXXYJ5nwqYisa9)

Also...too ambitious of a day?  Seems like too ambitious of a day (and maybe we won't do the Skogar musuem, but I do want to see turf houses, or maybe we should skip the glacier in August?), but I'm curious to hear what people think.",1,22.0
Comment,,_the_hare,2024-07-26 18:30:50,"This really does seem like an ambitious itenerary, I’d imagine the worst headache would be finding parking at some destinations like the upper parking at Dyrhólaey. I imagine things will take longer than expected with a larger party too, but I’d be prepared for things to take much longer than anticipated. 

Dyrhólaey was definitely worth seeing for us, best and closest view of puffins on the south coast that we saw. 

I’m not sure if I understand you correctly but Solheimajökull would still be fine to see in Aug, it’s there year-round. I’m only seeing a 15min drive time up the road to the glacier. I would prioritize this and instead cut Kvernufoss & Skogar museum and/or Reynisfjara. This is the best glacier access on the south coast before Vatnajökull and is unique among the other south coast sites like beaches and falls. 

No smaller roads between Dyrhólaey, Reynisfjara and Vík due to farmland and a steep rocky hill.",2,

Comment,,q_lee,2024-07-27 01:21:10,"We did the puffin and whale tour with North Sailing two weeks ago at 11 AM. We took our three children (9, 7, and 4) who all did fine. Saw two whales and had a great time. I can't promise that any of the tour companies will have enough space for that many people on a weekend with such short notice. 

As far as time of day for seeing whales, I don't think there's any time that will improve your chances in the summer. If you can find someone with 20 open seats for any time slot, I'd go for it. 

Good luck to you!",1,
Post,Trip report July 1 - 8,mlhom,2024-07-26 13:34:15,"Here is the trip report I promised. I went with my 2 best friends (friends for over 50 years!). This was our retirement trip – we left the husbands home and had a glorious week celebrating over 130 combined years of being nurses!  
\*\*It’s important to note – we did not rent a car and we based ourselves in Reykjavik.\*\*  
We knew it was pricier and meant more travel time, but it worked perfectly for us. We met so many nice people on every tour and we gathered a wealth of information from the tour guides, who kept us entertained on all the bus trips.  
We stayed in a charming AirBnb that was in the perfect location, walkable to everything! If anyone wants info on the AirBnb or has questions about being based in Reykjavik, please ask me!  
I did already do another post with photos, and another with tips and thoughts!

 THANK YOU to everyone here who answered my endless questions for a year!

MONDAY DAY 1

After an all night flight with no sleep, we went to the Blue Lagoon - everyone who had this suggestion was right – it was a great way to relax and begin our vacation. We would have just crashed at the air bnb, and then felt crummy the rest of the day. We took a transport bus to our AirBNB in Reykjavik, got a bit settled and then headed out for the Reykjavik Food Tour (with WAKE UP REYKJAVIK), where we tried, amongst other things, fermented shark, an authentic Icelandic hot dog and rye ice cream! Our guide Haddy was AWESOME! He made the tour so much fine. I’d highly recommend this tour. All the people on the tour with us were so very nice! We made a quick stop at Bonus after then crashed!

 

TUESDAY DAY 2

After what was to become an almost daily routine, we walked to Braud & Co. (2 minutes from the house) to grab coffee (it was so good, and I am fussy with my coffee) and a pastry. And yes, the cinnamon buns are to die for! Our tour this day was with ARCTIC ADVENTURES. It was a long but pleasant bus ride (18 passengers) Our tour guide was Justin, and he did a wonderful job. He entertained us with stories and interesting facts the whole way. After a very breezy but fun ferry ride, we spent the entire day at the Westman Islands. It was a fantastic day. We saw so many puffins (yay!), Icelandic horses, houses buried from an older volcano, visited a volcano museum, Elephant Rock, along with breathtaking scenery. We had a delicious meal at a restaurant on the island before we headed home. Once again, we met the nicest people from all over the world that toured with us. Another tour I would highly recommend.

 

WEDNESDAY DAY 3

A little drizzly on and off but not near as bad as I’ve heard it could be. Did some shopping. There are great local artisans around. Then we did the most interesting and fun history tour….. The Funky Walking History Tour with FUNKY ICELAND. Lolly our tour guide (and founder of the business) was a fantastic storyteller! We saw so many great sites… a cool sculpture garden, the first school in Iceland that allowed females (I think in 1909), gorgeous flowers throughout the city, to name a few. As with the other tours, we had a great, friendly tour group. The tour was over 3 hours, and the time flew. There are a lot of cats roaming around, but all with collars and tags and all so friendly.

We ate at Skall in the Food Hall, and it was one of the best dinners I’ve ever had. It was baked cod. My one friend had the same and the other had arctic char. Both prepared amazingly well.

Spent time with the “house cat” before turning in.



THURSDAY DAY 4

It started off chilly and drizzly but ended up being a nice day. We were so fortunate with the weather.  
Started off at our favorite bakery before heading out to the South Coast. Our tour this day was with ARCTIC ADVENTURES. Not many (if any others) do the long trek to the South Coast and Glacier Lagoon. Because of this, it was a large bus (the only one all week). We had a female tour guide (I forget her name). She was sweet, but pretty soft spoken and didn’t have the same enthusiastic personality of all the previous guides.

We were at Stjórnarfoss and Seljalandsfoss Waterfalls. Saw amazing scenery along the way before going to Diamond Beach, which has black sand. Pieces of broken off glaciers were found on the beach. We then went to the incomparable Glacier Lagoon. One of the largest glaciers in Europe is there. We took a boat ride in the lagoon all around the icebergs that broke off from the glacier, and held a piece that they said was about 800 years old. The black parts of the glacier pieces are volcanic ash from when the glacier was formed. And the blue happens when they flip. We then saw a huge lava field with volcanic rock covered in moss. Ended the day in Vik, where we ate famous Black Crust pizza and saw the iconic white church there. One negative was we had a very short time to eat dinner….we practically had to inhale it. The tour company definitely did not figure in enough time for dinner for a busload of people.

We were all tired at the end of the day, but it was so worth it.

 

FRIDAY DAY 5

We started the day with a yummy breakfast at Sandholt Bakery. Very unique meals. And to die for hot cross buns!! We shopped around a bit after breakfast.

We then went on a tour of the Golden Circle, with a private tour guide who I found through Facebook. He was nice, but more a driver than a tour guide. He did first drive us to a knifemaker in Reykjavik (guy makes his own, message me for link).  I really appreciated the ride there. It was a great find, I bought a handmade knife for my husband, which he absolutely loved! If you are into knives, it is worth it to check it out!

This was another day of amazing nature in Iceland.

We started the tour at Thingvellir National Park. Thingvellir is one of Iceland’s three national parks. The sun was shining, and it was beautiful. The fault line is between the tectonic plates North America and Euroasia. It is a stunning park. We saw where people go snorkeling.

We went to Gullfoss Falls - it’s like a smaller Niagara Falls. Just beautiful.

We watched the Geyser Hot Springs shoot up a few times. That was pretty impressive.

We went to a horse farm and got to feed them some treats. Then went to Friðheimar tomato farm and saw how they grow tomatoes, basil and veggies in Iceland. We did not eat there, I wish we did.

Kerid Crater was phenomenal! We were so impressed with it. We hiked to the top to get a better view.

We ended the day eating at Sumac, a middle eastern restaurant. The food was so good, we didn’t even stop to take pictures!  
If I visit Iceland again, I would skip the Golden Circle, but as first time visitors, I’d recommend it.

 

SATURDAY DAY 6

My favorite day!!  
After our daily coffee and pastry run, we went on a tour to Snaefellsnes peninsula. The tour company was EAST WEST. I’d say they were the most professional and competent of all of them. Our tour guy Leroy was absolutely wonderful. So personable and knowledgeable.

The weather was perfect. Sunny all day. Though the wind did kick in a few times.

Every day we think nothing can beat the scenery of the day before. But todays was spectacular!! We were in awe.

Ytri Tunga beach is where you can sometimes see seals. We only saw a few noses stick up.

Got to pet some really pretty horses, then had a homemade lunch at the horse farm. The food was really yummy. It was so nice to share a meal with people from all over the world.

Then it was off to Mt. Kirkjufell, where parts of The Game of Thrones were filmed.

Snæfellsjökull glacier was visible from so many areas.

Black beach at Djupalonssandur was pretty cool. There are “mountains” around it, which is actually very old volcanic material. When it breaks off, it turns to pebbles and eventually coarse black sand.

Arnarstapi fishing village was mind blowing. Nature at its best.

Buðarkirkja, the black church is an iconic site in Iceland.

After we got back to Reykjavik, we ate at a small seafood restaurant (Sea Baron) on the harbor. Had lobster soup and shrimp/seafood kabobs. The food was average, not our favorite meal in Iceland.

Then we walked around town and onto Rainbow Street. The large church is Hallgrímskirkja Church and is minutes from our house. The AirBnb we are staying in is central to everything.  
The Snaefellsnes tour was my favorite, and I would advise you to not miss visiting the peninsula. We were all so happy we did.

 

SUNDAY DAY 7

Final full day in Iceland.

No touring that day. It was a gorgeous day…. 60°, sunny and brilliant blue skies. We took a nice stroll by the Harbor in the morning. We saw the Sun Voyager sculpture (it is a dream boat and an ode to the sun. It represents the promise of undiscovered territory and a dream of hope, progress and freedom).

Had fabulous sandwiches for lunch at Sandholt Bakery before heading to Sky Lagoon. It was a perfect way to spend our last day. It’s so relaxing. And invigorating! We did the 7-step ritual, which includes a cold plunge. The infinity pool was so pretty. The waterfall was fun. We all liked it better than the Blue Lagoon. (But like the Golden Circle, if it’s your first time, I’d still do the Blue Lagoon)

We had our best meal of the entire trip that evening at Sjávargrillið Seafood Grill. Started with a delicious smooth wine and the best lobster taco appetizers I’ve ever tasted. We shared 3 main dishes… salted cod, Ling cod and seafood pasta. Every bite was delicious! We couldn’t say no to dessert. We shared an amazing crème brûlée and a delectable chocolate lava cake.

 

MONDAY DAY 8

The end of a truly memorable, once in a lifetime vacation. We had the best time, and all feel truly blessed that we were able to visit Iceland together.

We finally made it to the top of Hallgrímskirkja church, which was a 5 minute walk from our house. You could see the whole city from there.

And we saw a bride and groom getting ready to get married!  
The same person who did the Golden Circle tour drove us to the airport. Our luggage was so heavy, it was better than lugging it all to a bus stop.

We arrived home tired, but full of magical, endless memories.

Comment,,snizo_,2024-08-19 00:50:53,"I ended up changing my trip to September due to work so all I can tell you is what I've learned from reading care guides! 

1) Puffin Patrol isnt really a gathering of volunteers per se, you just kind of go out on your own at night. Pufflings get confused by artificial light, so in the city or by the harbor are probably your best bets. They can also be found not far from colonies, such as near Heimaklettur, Eiðið, and Dalfjall. 

2) Pufflings generally fledge (leave the nest) at the very end of August or early September. Puffling season typically ends ~4 weeks later. August 19th is probably slightly too early to see any pufflings, but you could try calling the Sea Life Trust and asking if they've had any puffling reports yet.  

3) Catching a Puffling:

-After dark, use a flashlight to check under cars, boxes, alleys, etc. for pufflings. Be very careful not to step on a puffling when chasing it! Use clean gloves when catching a puffling. Any standard pair should do, doesn't have to be medical gloves. Puffins are seabirds so they rely on a special oil coating on their feathers to remain waterproof. The oils on human hands can disrupt feather waterproofing if handled too much. Hold the bird with its wings pressed against its sides to prevent any injuries from flapping/wiggling. 

-After catching the puffling, place it in a cardboard box. You can also place grass at the bottom to help avoid pufflings from getting their own feces on them. This is a very stressful experience for them so keeping them in a dark, safe environment helps calm the bird. Be sure to use a box with proper airflow, but not holes big enough for the bird to escape or injure itself. Most local hotels and businesses can give you a box or assist you in finding one. Avoid handling the bird once it is in the box - remember these are wild animals that need rescuing and too much human interaction can be harmful! 

-DO NOT feed the bird. Oils from fish placed in the box can harm the feathers. 

-Ideally only keep 1 bird per box. 


4) Releasing a Puffling:

-Pufflings MUST be released the next morning. If your puffling seems injured, lethargic, or underweight (underweight birds have a very prominent and pointy breastbone rather than a rounded one) please take it to the Sea Life Trust where a rehab team can give it medical attention! You can also bring your healthy bird to the Sea Life Trust in the morning to get it checked out & weighed for researcher data. 

-If your bird is healthy you can go release it! DO NOT release it in the harbor, as oils from ships can damage the feathers. Popular release spots include cliffs, beaches, or boats out at sea away from human activity. 

-When releasing the bird, hold it firmly around the midsection but do not cover the wings. Toss your arms up gently one or two times before releasing the bird to allow it to feel the wind and prepare for flight. Toss your bird into the air over the water. At this point, many pufflings WILL NOT fly - that is okay! Often pufflings will sit on the water for a second or two before diving below. Whether your puffling flys or dives is perfectly fine. 

5) Remember that Puffin Patrol is a rescue effort! Pufflings are not pets and should be handled, treated, and respected as wild animals. As exciting as it is to see a puffling, please act safely and responsibly when on patrol. 

Hope this helps!",4,

Comment,,snizo_,2024-12-11 16:04:27,"

If you go in May you'll see adult puffins - if you go in September you MIGHT see pufflings. If your primary goal is to see puffins I'd probably go in May. 

In September the adult puffins have all gone out to sea and most of the pufflings are gone too. I ended up seeing one puffling by the Westman Islands harbor on September 14th around 10:15pm, but that was very unexpected. No one was out doing puffin patrol except us, and we got worried that we looked sketchy so finished by 11:30 or so. My understanding is that tourists are welcome to join in puffling patrol so long as you're being respectful (see my guide below), but if you're visiting specifically for puffling patrol I'd plan to go during late August or during the very first few days of September when everyone else is out.",1,
Comment,,snizo_,2024-09-04 00:37:06,I'm glad it helped! I've read that about 9pm-3am tends to be the common time to find pufflings. Typically anytime after dark should be fine.,1,
Post,Is an 8 Day Trip including Akureyri feasible?,Bighairedaristocrat,2024-07-21 21:34:26,"My wife and I are planning a trip to Iceland in September and working with a travel agent on kimkim to help plan our trip.  We are not good planners, so having the agent is very helpful. 

We are in our early 40s and love to do relatively short hikes (no more than a couple hours) and want to see as much of Iceland as we can without feeling rushed.  

We initially had a plan that had us stay around the south of the island for the full trip, and we’d  get to spend 2 nights in a coupe hotels, and that seemed nice to us, so we wouldn’t have to deal with checking in somewhere new and packing/unpacking our stuff every day.  

We really want to visit South Iceland, especially the black sand beaches and Vik.  However, we started reading about Akureryi in North Iceland and decided to try and incorporate that into our trip.  Specifically, we want to go to places like Geosea and Forest Lagoon. And we hear that Puffin and Whale watching can be done up there.

The agents suggestion is that since we’re going all the way up there we might as well drive around the entire island, but seems like ALOT of driving where we’d spend so much time in the car, we wouldn’t be able to ACTUALLY DO as much.  So now we’re back to thinking we should try to limit how much of Iceland we see.

Does anyone have recommendations on how to make best use of our 8 days in Iceland.  Is there a section of the island we could leave off of our itinerary this time to cut down on the amount of time were spend driving? ",1,11.0
Comment,,q_lee,2024-07-21 23:13:52,"I just did 8 days (3 in Reykjavik, 5 on the road) and hit all the areas you're looking at. I was traveling with young kids so we didn't do any big hikes and just focused on seeing the sights. Our first two and final day of the trip were spent in Reykjavik.

First day with a car was a day trip from Reykjavik to Reynisfjara including a lava tunnel tour. 

Second day was the golden circle, spent the night in Borgarnes. 

Third day was a drive to Husavik with a stop in Akureyri for a few hours to eat lunch and walk around. 

Fourth day was whale and puffin watching out of Husavik   (tour start was delayed from 8:45 to 11:00 AM). We then drove about 6.5 hours back to the tip of Snæfellsnes.

Fifth day was touring Snæfellsnes and then back to Reykjavik.

It was a lot of driving but we got to see a lot of stuff. If you weren't looking to spend a ton of time in Reykjavik, you could make a couple of these stops (maybe Vík and Akureyri) two day stays and explore those areas in more depth.",1,
Post,Snæfellsnes or Heimaey (Westman islands)? ,Toobukoo,2024-07-20 21:23:16,"We may have to choose one or the other with our itinerary. 

Which one is better, has more spectacular scenery, or would be a more unique and memorable experience?  I’d like to see both but it might be too rushed and too much running around.

With our itinerary, we’d be arriving in Heimaey around 17:00 and have to leave the next day to drive 4.5 hrs to snaefellness. So we might want to stay 2 nights on Heimaey and skip snaefellnes. Or just skip the island and do snaefellnes. Just wondering if it’s worth the trouble to see both with limited time, and the best option if we need to choose one. 

I’m traveling with wife and kids (9 and 13) and they would probably be interested in seeing puffins and fairy/elf garden in westman. But maybe they can see puffins elsewhere in Iceland. 

We’ll be there the last week in July. I think there’s a festival in westman in early Aug, so maybe it’ll be more crowded when we go. 

I appreciate any advice or recommendations. 

Thanks,

Comment,,PalePast,2024-07-21 21:45:30,"We loved both, but with the amount of time you have Westman Islands is what I would pick. It’s a small island and one full day/two nights should be plenty of time if you have a car on the island. Get to the lookout for the puffins early in the morning. Snaefellsnes is great, too, but a lot more to see/do and takes more time to drive between all of the major sites. We had a full day at both places which felt just enough for Heimaey (although would love to go back- saw the most puffins here and it magical) and too short for all of Snaefellsnes.",2,
Post,Camera kit advice from my recent trip!,DrSnowballEsq,2024-07-19 17:58:59,"I just got back from my fourth visit to Iceland, and my first time with a dedicated camera. I researched my kit a lot before going, and wanted to give back a little with some points I did not see raised in other posts. For context I am just an amateur hobbyist a few years into shooting, and I shot hiking, family, basic landscapes, waterfalls, and [**puffins**](https://imgur.com/a/WL27M3n). My kit was a Fuji X-T4 with the 16-80 f4 and 70-300 f4-5.6, and I took an ND8 (3 stop) filter.  

* I wish I'd brought a wider aperture lens and a stronger ND filter for waterfalls -- the issue isn't light, it's water on the lens! I never saw this in any other posts and didn't think of it until I experienced it myself. The wider your aperture, the less you need to worry about keeping your lens clean. I spent most of my waterfall shooting at f8 or higher, and constantly worried about wiping my lens clean because droplets would otherwise show in the shot. You either need a fast lens to blast through droplets on the glass, or to shoot from far outside the mist zone. But distance presents another issue...

* Weather can impact image clarity at distance way more than you expect, especially on a telephoto. We had light rain for half the trip and the telephoto turned in awful images if I wasn't up close. Once things cleared up, it was another matter, but for misty days the telephoto was deadweight. 

* Unless you are using expensive filters, IMO don't bother adapting them across lenses. The time I spent swapping both lenses and filters, and the inability to use my lens hood with adapted filters, was not worth the meager savings. 

I'm happy with my kit overall and got great images I know my family will treasure. That said, for my style, I think an all-purpose zoom like the Tamron 18-300 paired with a fast prime (or at least a f2.8 zoom) would have been better. While F4 wasn't limiting for summer light at all, I was very surprised by how limiting it was for mist on the lens.",11,11.0
Comment,,NWinston,2024-07-20 02:58:07,"I think a 10 stop ND is the way to go, but sturdy tripod is definitely necessary. 

My last trip I brought the Canon RF24-240mm lens and the RF800mm F/11 for puffins, along with 10 stop ND. It was a solid setup and gave me a lot of versatility. If it was fall/winter I’d take some fast primes for auroras.",2,
Comment,,icelandisaverb,2024-07-20 06:19:00,"Love the puffins photo. My first time in Iceland in 2017, viewed through a Fuji XT-2, renewed my love of photography (after years with Canon). Such fun cameras.",1,
Post,Itinerary & Notes after July 2024 Ring Road Camper Trip,_the_hare,2024-07-18 21:05:42,"Wanted to post our itinerary of our completed 8 full days in a camper van touring the Ring Road + Snæfellsnes and a few more notes on our experience, hope it’s helpful!

Day 1—Setup & Golden Circle

—Land in morning after overnight flight, pick up van midmorning 

—Groceries at Costco

—Þórufoss

—Hike around Þingvellir, 2.5mi

—Strokkur geyser area

—Gullfoss

—Stay at Þykkvabær camping 

Þingvellir was awesome to walk through, beautiful scenery and vibrant energy from the many gatherings there over the centuries. The Strokkur geothermal area honestly was small potatoes compared to Yosemite NP in the US, but Strokkur certainly holds its own as a geyser! Had Gullfoss nearly all to ourselves at the end of the day. Beautiful seeing the extensive sunset over the highland peaks.


Day Two—South Coast Falls

—Gljúfrabúi and Seljalandsfoss

—Íráfoss

—Skógafoss and Fimmvörðuháls hike to bridge, 10mi

—Upper Dyrhólaey sea arch lookout with puffins

—Stay at Vík camping

Even though every day was a highlight, the waterfall canyon past Skógafoss was probably the most amazing activity of our trip. Around every corner was a new waterfall that would have a whole state park dedicated to it back in the states. The sky was slightly overcast up until the very end where it cleared to reveal the Eyjafjallajökull glacier. This day we also realized we’d have to cut many smaller falls and canyons off our planned itinerary since we had planned to already be at Skaftafell by this evening. This felt ok though since we had such an amazing waterfall experience along the Skógá canyon.


Day Three—Vatnajökull Glaciers & lagoons

—Eldhraun lava field 

—Dverghamrar cliffs

—Hike up past Svartifoss to glacier lookout, 5mi

—Visited other glacier lookouts on the way to Jökulsárlón

—Stay at Svinafell camping

I was wondering why the Skaftafell visitor center didn’t really have great scenic trail access to the glacier itself until I realized from the lookout information sign that it had retreated a whole kilometer within my lifetime. Really impactful experience to say the least. Hearing the glaciers rumble as they slide downhill was unforgettable as well, yet another example of the many great and powerful kinetic entities that make this land feel alive.


Day Four—Jökulsárlón & Eastfjord sightseeing

—Jökulsárlón Zodiac boat tour

—Höfn ocean lookout

—Skútafoss valley, 1.2mi RT hike up

—Hvalsnes nature reserve pebble beach

—Djúpivogur peninsula town lookout at Bóndavarða memorial

—Fossá river falls short hike

—Stay at Reyðarfjörður camping 

The Zodiac boat was great value, we were able to go nearly all the way up to the glacier. Again another sobering moment—we paused at some exposed rock islands in the bay with the glacier still a long ways off and the guide noted that these islands were covered by the glacier only 6 years ago. This drive felt a bit extensive but the enormous mountains along the many Eastfjörds were an endless sight to behold!


Day Five—Northeastern sites

—Hengifoss falls hike, 3mi RT

—Stuðlagil basalt canyon hike, 3mi RT

—Dettifoss down west road 862

—Hljóðaklettar lava caves & Rauðhólar mtn overlook

—Stay at Húsavík camping

Stuðlagil canyon was really the only time I felt let down at a location. I had heard about the canyon years ago and hyped it up in my head, but it felt much smaller and less saturated in person and was a bit effortful to get there with a bumpy road and brand new Parka fee. I really enjoyed the near-barren landscape near the intersection of the ring road with route 901, really seemed like the surface of another planet. Dettifoss was like looking at a god—definitely a must see stop in the northeast! Beautiful watching the sun dipping beneath the ocean horizon at 12:30am while making dinner. 


Day Six—Whale tour, Mývatn, drive back west

—Morning whale tour in Húsavík

—Dimmuborgir lava structures

—Hverfjall hike up to high point, 2mi 

—Goðafoss

—Poke around Akureyri city

—Stay at Snorrastaðir camping

The whale tour was another highlight—we went with Gentle Giants in a boat that could quickly access faraway parts of the bay. Surreal moment where everyone is silently anticipating the next whale surface and seeing the massive being swim right under our boat. Dimmuborgir was cool to look at from above on Hverfjall, interesting that the lava structures appeared to be in a circle like some sort of Stonehenge. Shifted plans significantly by skipping our detour to the witchcraft museum we had planned for the next day and instead drove all the way to the base of Snæfellsnes—didn’t pull up to the site til around 3:30am. 


Day Seven—Snæfellsnes

—Búðir black church

—Rauðfeldur canyon

—Arnarstapi sea cliffs

—Djúpalónssandur beach 

—Saxhóll crater stair climb

—Kirkjufell lookout

—Stay at Akranes camping 

Djúpalónssandur was the highlight of this day. The contrasting colors of the black pebbles, white froth, and light blue water was striking, and the rushing sound of the retreating seawater through the pebbles made it a wholistic sensory experience. Nearly laughed when we came around to Kirkjufell, the last sight of the trip—at this point we’d seen so many mountains many times taller with more striking features and this hill with a 1000 ISK fee makes its way into top-10 sights lists? It unsettles me to see otherwise fine if not a little average places transform into a marketed Instagram background through social media trends and internet listicles when there’s just so, so much else out there to see. Our most treasured memories were dynamic experiences moving through the landscape that just could not be captured in a moment at all, either by word or image. 


Day Eight—Reykjavík & Blue Lagoon

—National Museum of Iceland

—Hallgrímskirkja and souvenir shopping

—Blue lagoon

—Stay at Happy Camper camping

We intended to do these activities in town on our first day but decided to save them for last on the way to Blue Lagoon. The National Museum was informative and succinct and helped fill in a lot of context for important figures in Iceland’s development and its religious, political and economic history. Had the best time at Blue Lagoon—after a go-go-go pace of this trip this was the first time we could really kick back and relax for a while in a very cool setting, definitely worth it for us!


Day Nine—Return home

—Drop off van in early morning & take taxi to airport


This was certainly the trip of a lifetime! One thing that really made this trip was a near-perfect weather window—mostly clear skies with no rain or serious wind up until we returned to the west side. We really enjoyed being able to see the mountains both near and far and not be wet the whole time due to our inadequate rain gear. 

Our camper van was a great way to go for us—freedom to cook our own cheap groceries and not have to pay for expensive restaurants, freedom to change campsite plans if we needed and pull in at any time, and of course having our transportation and lodging mostly rolled into one smaller fee. 

Our itinerary definitely wasn’t a leisurely pace. While we feel like we stayed long enough at every place and didn’t feel rushed, we kept moving from place to place and didn’t get a chance to kick our feet up until our handful of hours at the Blue Lagoon. We pulled into campsites late into the night (or next morning!), slept in when we could, and relied on instant coffee and <$1 Red Bulls to keep alert throughout the day. 

Originally our planned itinerary featured many more sites, but we ended up cutting much of it. I’m glad I didn’t waste time trying to plan things by the minute! It took longer than we expected to get set up for our trip, driving always took longer than expected due to scenic pull-offs and various stops, and we usually ended up spending a lot more time than anticipated at one unique site per day. Many grand features like the waterfall canyon hike past Skógafoss often overshadowed other similar features so we felt ok bypassing them or just seeing them from the road. 

I also didn’t realize how much I’d be drawn to doing things in the evening and night when there was little traffic and the sunset lasted for hours. There was plenty of light to see by at 10pm but much less traffic and fellow tourists even at the most popular sights. I really love sunsets and drank in every minute I could have the clouds that would stay painted pink and orange throughout the brief night and on into the sunrise. 

Thanks for reading! I think Iceland is unique in its having so many gorgeous features packed in to a relatively small and accessible area and I’m so thankful I was able to experience it!",12,1.0

Post,Itinerary help!,Sad-Banana-9200,2024-07-17 14:19:40,"

I have two full days solo in Reykjavik at the very end of August before I start a hiking tour, so I'm planning the following. Let me know if this is crazy, or if I've missed anything spectacular/must dos! My hotel is close to BSI and Hallgrimskirkja so I feel like it is a good location for walkability.

Day 1

* Red eye lands at KEF at 8:40am, and I've booked the flybus to my hotel.
* drop off bags at \~10:30/11am, stroll around, and find a brunch spot
* walking tour of Reykjavik to get my bearings/see some sights from 1:30-3:30
* quick check-in back at hotel/get freshened up
* whale watching tour from 5pm-8pm
* grab a bite to eat, maybe hotdog or something else casual
* Sleep!

Day 2

* breakfast at hotel
* take a taxi to Sky Lagoon for the morning (I'm not a huge water person but do like a quick soak and want to experience the public open water scene)
* taxi back to hotel around 12ish (I'm thinking 3 hours at Sky Lagoon will be enough for me), and then:
   * Get lunch somewhere and explore Reykjavik on my own, \*OR\*
   * take a food tour (3-4 hours), \*OR\*
   * Go on a snorkeling tour to the Silfra Fissure (from 1:30-5:30)
* Back at hotel to freshen up for dinner out (I booked myself dinner at ROK)
* Get a good sleep and be ready for my 5 night hike the next day!

Is the whale watching tour going to be worth it/will there be whales that time of year? I noticed that there are no puffin-viewing tours that late in August so I guess the season is over :(. Anyone done a food tour they liked? I love snorkeling/scuba so feel like it is a missed opportunity NOT to do it anywhere and everywhere I can, but do recognize I'm really packing it in!

Post,"Trip Report: 8 Days in July, Reykjavik to Southeast Iceland (not quite to Hofn)",PinkRibbonRedLeader,2024-07-16 17:06:42,"I really appreciate the information we got from this sub, so I'm returning the favor with a trip report. Hope it helps someone with planning. This was one of the best family trips we've ever been on, and I can't wait to return. Here's my report:

**\~Trip dates\~**:  July 5 to July 13

**\~Travelers:\~**  two middle-aged parents in our 50s (moderate fitness) and college-age son (moderate fitness)

**\~General Tips:\~**

* **Iceland Air** can be strict with carry-on luggage sizes. We had friends who went to Iceland two months before us who had to gate-check their carry-on bags because they were ½ inch too long, and one of their bags was slightly too heavy. We bought a cheap luggage scale from Amazon to make sure our bags were within the weight limit and also bought [Rockland Fashion Softside Upright Luggage Set (14""/19"")](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CBT5C4C?_encoding=UTF8&ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_J49RYF951AXM5AGEW3SQ&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_J49RYF951AXM5AGEW3SQ&social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_J49RYF951AXM5AGEW3SQ&skipTwisterOG=2&th=1) (link from Amazon) as carry-on bags for each of us because the carry-on size bags we had were over Iceland Air’s size limit by an inch or two. We had no problems.
* **Insurance**:  we bought the full insurance coverage for our rental car for peace of mind about sand/wind and other damage. We also bought Allianz trip cancellation/interruption insurance with emergency medical evacuation coverage. For trip cancellation/interruption, I bought Allianz to have just one company to deal with a claim rather than separate coverage from Airline, AirBnB and medical. For medical, I called our insurance company. While they cover medical visits in Iceland, they did not cover medical evacuation. Since we were travelling to places with no local hospital and we have a family member with a food allergy, and medical evacuation can be $$$, we decided to get this coverage with Allianz for peace of mind.
* **Phone/texting**:  We got Verizon Travel Pass ($10/day if you use it). We also got a WiFi hotspot with our rental car. We didn’t really use the Travel Pass, but did use the WiFi hotspot for things like paying for parking on Parka App, but not sure that’s totally necessary as there are payment kiosks. We also used it to look up places to eat while on the road.
* **Peanut allergy.** Thank you to posters who posted about traveling in Iceland with a peanut allergy. We have a family member with one, and had absolutely no problems. Every single restaurant was peanut-free (we asked every time).

**\~Day 1\~**  Flew Iceland Air overnight from Dulles (Washington D.C.) direct to Keflavik. Arrived Keflavik about 6:30 am. Rented car from Blue, walked across parking lot to pick up car. 

**TIP**:  take phone off airplane mode to get the text with lockbox code for contactless car pick up from Blue. We were jet lagged and couldn’t figure out why we couldn’t get the lock box code and had to go in for assistance.

Drove to AirBnB in Reykjavik; host was very nice and let us check in upon arrival at about 8:30 am (we had pre-arranged this with the host at the time we booked the AirBnB). Stopped by grocery to pick up Skyr, bread, etc for breakfasts. Napped at AirBnB until about noon, then went out to explore the Hallgrimskirkja church, Rainbow Street, did part of Rick Steves book walking tour. Ate cinnamon rolls at Braud for snack. Dinner at Café Loki by Hallgrimskirkja; I had the Gratinated mashed fish with rye bread and salad at Loki, which was very good. I wished we had room to try the rye bread ice cream, but we were too full. Wished we had shared entrees – they were large.

**\~Day 2\~**  10:00 am entry to Sky Lagoon (booked in advance), then simple lunch at the Sky Lagoon café. Wonderful experience. Drove back to Reykjavik and walked around some more, saw Hofdi, Harpa concert hall, Sun Voyager, etc. Had hotdogs at BBP for afternoon snacks and soup and skewers for simple dinner at the Sea Baron (lobster soup was very nice).

**\~Day 3\~** Day trip around Golden Circle from Reykjavik. Visited Thingvellir, then Fontana Thermal Pool for a simple lunch at their café (the rye bread was quite good) and a soak in their thermal pools. Then ice cream at Efstidalur dairy farm (sat in front of window looking into the barn full of cows!), then saw Geysir and Gullfoss. Stopped at the “Old Dairy” Selfoss food hall for dinner. Son loved his burger, husband loved his elevated street tacos, and my glazed cod from Samuelsson Matbar was amazing. The town square is cute with the steps painted to look like books written by Icelandic authors. Drove back to Reykjavik. (We liked having a home base in Reykjavik for 3 days, but it might have been a good idea to stay in Selfoss this night to save a little driving).

**\~Day 4\~**  Left Reykjavik about 9:00 am to catch the 12:00 noon ferry (booked in advance) from Landeyjahofn to Vestmannaeyjar/Heimaey Island/Westman Islands (packed snacks to eat on drive). Ate late lunch at Vigtin Bakhus bakery (simple sandwiches), then drove up to the Eldheimar Volcano Museum. Did the museum audio tour, then hiked up to the top of the Eldfell volcano crater. It was a steep challenge for us, but worth it. Hiked back to our car at the museum parking lot, then did a self-drive tour around the island using the map from the visitor’s center, which showed good puffin-viewing spots. We pulled over at a marked parking area and saw lots of puffins!

**TIP:** bring binoculars. We saw some puffins with the naked eye, but binoculars helped. 

Caught the 6:00 pm ferry back to mainland and drove to AirBnB in Vik. Ate dinner in Vik at the Soup Company (delicious chocolate-banana cake for dessert). Went to Kronan in the Icewear Magasin Mall to get Skyr, etc. for breakfasts and lunch supplies. Spent night in Vik. In retrospect, it might have been good to spend this night in Vestmannaeyjar to save a little driving.

**\~Day 5\~** From AirBnB in Vik, backtracked and drove to Seljalandsfoss Waterfall, then worked our way back to Vik, stopping at the various sites along the way.

**TIP**: For Seljalandsfoss, wear waterproof shoes and waterproof jacket with hood. We were fine with ""water-resistant"" hiking pants (rather than fully waterproof pants). We also had waterproof covers for day packs. You will get wet from the spray, particularly if you walk behind the falls.

Ate packed lunch. After Seljalandsfoss, stopped at Skogafoss waterfall. The walk up the staircase was a little challenging, but worth it. Next stop, walked the path toward the Solheimajokull Glacier. We did not do glacier walk here, because we had one booked at Skaftafell. It was a nice walk, but probably skippable if pressed for time. Next, we did the Dyrholaey Promontory (sea arch). Parked at the upper lot, saw puffins, walked around the light house. At this point we were starting to get tired, and needed to do laundry at the AirBnB, so we just did a quick stop at the Reynisfjara Black Sand beach. It was really cool, and the caves and basalt rock formations were awesome. Drove back to Vik, started laundry and rested, then went to Strondin Pub for dinner. Really good fish and chips, and saw some of the England vs. Netherlands soccer match with patrons/fans supporting both sides cheering spiritedly. Spent night in Vik.

**\~Day 6\~** Left Vik in the morning and drove to Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon. We loved this! Walked around and marveled. Saw a seal in the lagoon. Next, drove to Diamond Beach, parked facing the beach and enjoyed an amazing view while we ate our packed lunch in the car. Got out and walked around, marveled at the “diamond” chunks of ice on the black sand beach. Drove to Fjallsarlon, saw the small lagoon and glacier briefly. Back to car, drove to Troll Expeditions to take Glacier Hike tour (pre-booked) at Skaftafell. We really enjoyed the Glacier Hike. It was a little challenging, but worth it. Older people or those with mobility limitations might get an equally enjoyable experience from an amphibious boat tour at the Glacier Lagoon. Drove to AirBnB (“summer house” cottage) at Guesthouse Gerdi (west of Hofn, near the Porbergssetur museum – outside is painted to look like a giant bookshelf).  Ate dinner at Guesthouse Gerdi (need to call ahead). Simple, but delicious dinner of Icelandic char (or lamb), potatoes and vegetables. Dessert skyr and rhubarb crumble were yum!

**\~Day 7\~**  Breakfast at Guesthouse Gerdi (paid the night before), then drove back to Reykjavik. Stopped in Vik for lunch at Halldorskaffi café (pizza and salads were good, cute visitor’s center and gift shop attached). Stopped at Bobby Fischer Center for a stretch break, mildly interesting. Very rainy day, a bit of scary fog to drive through on Hwy 1 from Vik to Selfoss. Dinner in Reykjavik at Messinn Seafood restaurant. Reservations recommended, but we got reservations 45 minutes before we went. The Plokkfiskur was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Walked around afterwards. Spent night in AirBnB in Seltjarnarnares, about a 20 minutes’ walk from Reykjavik city center.

**\~Day 8\~**  Poured rain, gusty wind. Went to the National Museum for a couple of hours, then walked through the flea market. Had lunch at the Reykjavik Fish Restaurant (fish and chips were good), then did some souvenir shopping and went through the Punk Rock Museum. Around 3:30, drove to Keflavik, returned rental car to Blue and flew home.

Post,11 day trip report in July,nebotron,2024-07-11 15:01:37,"3 days in Snæfellsnes

* Stayed at Fosshotel Hellnar. Really liked it. The staff was friendly, breakfast was convenient and tasty, and the view from the dining area is incredible on a clear day.
* Laki whale watching out of Olafsvik. Saw two pods of orcas, both with calves, and dolphins bow-rided on the boat! Really magical experience.
* Arnarbær - great food in Arnarstapi
* Bjarnarhöfn Shark Museum - quite cool! quick stop, cheap tickets, and an interesting view on a piece of icelandic history (greenland shark hunting and preparation)
* Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge - really magical place to walk in. Bring good water proof boots. It may be blocked by ice, even as late as July.
* Vatnshellir cave - there are other more interesting caves in Iceland, like the caves of Hella. I'd probably skip this one.
* Gerðuberg Cliffs - If you've seen a picture, you've seen the cliffs. Stop if it's on the way, but otherwise skip it.
* Landbrotalaug Hot Springs - trickle of very hot water coming out of the ground. If you like a project, its fun to move around the rocks to try to build a hot pool. Bring good boots, and ideally a shovel.

2 days in Heimaey

* Seabirds and Cliffs adventures RIB boat tour. So great! One of our favorite experiences. We saw the huge colonies of nesting seabirds from the water. The tour guide (who was born in Heimaey) shared stories from his childhood there, and from the eruption.
* Puffin Lookout - They are so cute! Stay on the trail to avoid scaring them or crushing the burrows. Bring binoculars if you have them.
* Naes - Incredible food. A bit on the expensive side, but worth it. Must try.
* SEA LIFE Trust sanctuary - very unique experience to see Beluga whales up close.
* Eldheimar - Eldfell eruption museum. Very informative audio tour that makes good use of the space around an excavated home that was buried by the eruption. There's a Surtsey exhibit upstairs that's more about the geological/biological evolution of a new island, but I don't think it's quite as powerful as the downstairs exhibit.

3 days in Selfoss

* Reykjadalur hot river hike. Very neat hike, and the hot river at the end is fun. I enjoyed moving rocks around to make pools of hot and cold water. Bring a bug net - there are flies. The flies don't bother you when you're in the water though.
* Strokkur is neat to see. It erupts pretty high and regularly. Crowded though.
* Gullfoss Waterfall Lookout - Very crowded with tourists. It's a remarkable waterfall, but so is almost every other waterfall in iceland. I'd go elsewhere, like seljandafoss and Gjlubfrui.
* Almar Bakari - really wonderful pastries and sandwiches, great hot chocolate.
* Hótel Selfoss - not great. The rooms get stuffy because the window is tiny, the shower is minuscule, and they have lamps right above the bed we repeatedly hit our heads on.
* Messinn - incredible plokfiskur and rye bread
* Staldrið Food Truck - best hot dog I've had in iceland. They let you eat in a geothermally heated greenhouse, which is very neat. The spa next door, Krauma, isn't great.

3 days in Reykjavik

* The Maritime Museum was very thoughtfully put together and we enjoyed it very much. I found the exhibits on climate change and the cod wars particularly good.
* Skal! - Incredible restaurant. Went there twice and wish I could go again.
* Apotek - the lunch deal is really good. Very high quality food.
* Cafe Loki - The rye bread ice cream is incredible. You must try it. IMO, its by far the best thing on their menu. I probably wouldn't bother with anything else.
* Perlan - super disappointing and overrated museum, in my opinion. The information is very surface level, and mostly what you can get just from reading Wikipedia. The interactive exhibits actively get in the way of learning, rather than enhancing it. The ice cave made me really uncomfortable - they took a chunk of ice from a glacier (which is actively melting) and commodified it. They were encouraging people to make instagram posts while posing in the ice throne, but had no information about where the ice was from, the age of the ash layers, or any surrounding context. Frankly irresponsible presentation of the content for a museum.
* Svarta Kaffið - the soup is pretty good, but the bread itself in the bread bowls isn't. I probably wouldn't go again. If you want bread bowls, consider Icelandic Street Food. Better, IMO, and free refills!
* Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur - I get that it's historical, but the hot dog is like every other. Skip it.
* Free walking Tour Reykjavik CityWalk - Very entertaining tour, and you pay whatever you think it's worth. I'd definitely recommend it.
* Penis Museum - super funny, and actually very educational museum. I'd recommend spending an hour or so here.
* Art museums - you can get a day pass to all three museums together. They are pretty good museums if you like art, so consider making a day of it!",7,1.0
Post,"Help with itinerary! 4 1/2 day trip, Reykjavik as home base. ",BlakeSwag,2024-07-09 21:53:25,"Hey everyone! 

I haven't had to plan an international trip by myself in a LONG time. I'm hoping for some feedback and ideas on our general itinerary plans. Here we go! We go at the end of July (which is SOON, i know). 

Day 1:   
We land at 6am. I have this day essentially open to explore the city or just take things easy. I'm not really sure what else to do with this day! We love museums so we could pick a few to do this day. 

Day 2:   
This will be our Southern Iceland Tour day. We have rented a car.   
We will be hitting Caves of Hella Tour, Black Sand Beaches, Several waterfalls (Seljalandsfoss and Skagafoss), also exploring the town of VIK

Day 3:  
Golden Circle Day with rented car. Top hits of course, Thingvellir National Park, Strokkur Geysir, Gullfoss Waterfall, and exploring the lands/wine bat at Friðheimar. (couldn't get a reservation). After all this I figured we'll mosey back to the city for rest/dinner. 

Day 4: (we don't have a car for this day)  
Our last full day. We'll be exploring the city and doing some shopping/other museums. We have a walking tour in the afternoon about the magical folk. 

  
Things I am wondering: when should we go to the hot springs?! Is that something we should do on our golden circle day or book a tour? I want to make sure i see some puffins as well. I would love any thoughts and advice! ",1,1.0
Comment,,World_travel777,2024-07-09 22:47:14,You could go to Sky Lagoon on 1st day. We did and it worked out.  We did a 1 hour boat  tour to see puffins. You could do this on day 1 also. Company guarantees 100% you’ll see puffins. We used special tours which is located at the harbor. Do book because they sell out. Google the company.  They provide binoculars too. Cost was about $54 USD. Good luck!!,2,
Post,"5 day trip report, July 2024",mayoforsam,2024-07-09 19:00:22,"I’m just back from Iceland after a 5 day trip and I thought I’d share some of my experiences seeing as how I gleaned so much information from this subreddit before I went.

So basically my wife and I are in our mid-50’s, semi-active and we both like the outdoors life. Iceland has always been one place I’ve always wanted to go to on my bucket list and I managed to convince my wife (who was initially a little reluctant) to go on a trip when we would normally be heading to fairer climes in Italy or Spain this time of year.

I booked return flights from Dublin to Keflavik with Play, got a good deal a few months back which worked out around €500 in total for the both of us (only a 2 hour plane ride also).

I pre-booked a small campervan from KuKu campers after reading some of their reviews (and being entertained by their off-beat sense of humour). I do have my own self-built VW Caddy micro-camper that my wife thinks is too small but I decided to go with KuKu anyways and we actually got a larger vehicle than I expected (a Nissan NV200 minivan with a heater that we didn't actually need much because of the pleasant weather). The camper van came with all the basic essentials for cooking, etc. I brought two of our own sleeping bags as we had room in our luggage plus some coffee mugs.

We spent our first night in Reykjavik in the Eco Village campsite a few km’s from the city centre (I also pre-booked the campsite and got the key-code emailed to me in advance, so no check-in was needed). We used the Hopp app to rent 2 e-scooters to get into Reykjavik that afternoon for a look around the sites (Hallgrimskirkja church, Rainbow Street, etc.) and got something handy to eat in one of the many restaurants.

Prices are very high in Iceland, even more so than Ireland which isn't exactly cheap either. For that first evening, I had also pre-booked a whale-watching trip from the harbour under the midnight sun. We were out in the bay for almost 3 hours and it was pretty breezy and cold, but the tour operator did provide us with waterproof coveralls which kept us warm (for my wife, I stuck it out). Unfortunately, there were no whales to be seen (apparently someone glimpsed the fin of a harbour porpoise) and we were offered a voucher to go on another trip - alas it was no good to us as we didn’t intend hanging around Reykjavik for another day.

The following morning, we drove up to Þingvellir National Park which is one of the first stops on the Golden Circle. We parked in the overflow spot for Öxarárfoss Parking P2 and walked down for about 20 minutes to the visitor centre and between the rift walls. The weather was fantastic and this was a great introduction to the Icelandic landscape. Lots of tourists around as expected on the Golden Circle. After about 90 minutes there, we drove off to our next stop, Geysir. To be honest, I thought we might get to do some more hiking during our trip but Iceland is much more spread out than I thought and there’s a lot to take in, so we decided to focus on the main tourist spots for our first visit. Again, massive crowds at Geysir which took something from the experience but it was still worth seeing nature clearing its throat every 10 minutes. 

Our final main stop for the day was Gulfoss. Again many other tourists but the majestic waterfall has to be seen to be believed. We then made tracks for our campsite for the night and the Secret Lagoon, which I had also pre-booked. I decided to take a short cut to avoid the traffic around Geysir and we ended up on a secondary road not really designed for 2WD campervans, but the scenery was lovely including many Icelandic horses (they love their horses in this country). Eventually we got to our campsite in Fludir (after a hot dog and coffee break) and booked in for the night. It was full of Icelandic local families up for the weekend but we managed to get a decent spot (in general the campsites were all peaceful and quiet at night). The Secret Lagoon was only a 20 minute walk from there. That was a very enjoyable way to end the day - the facility is nicely laid out, not overly commercialised and the warm water was very soothing, if a little murky but very natural with no chemicals. You do have to respect the Icelandic pre-bathing shower ritual in the nip but it was no big deal. 

After a good night’s rest, it was off to the south coast (‘waterfall day’). We stopped at the main falls along the way including Gljufrabui and Seljalandsfoss (paid parking) and Skógafoss (free but not for too much longer apparently). Lots of tourists at all the waterfalls, especially Skógafoss. You can get wet if you want to but it’s not essential to get some good photos. It is worth climbing up the side of Skógafoss if you’re semi-fit but there were some older people and young kids that probably should not have attempted the climb. We had a very nice picnic lunch at the top.

Final visit of the day was to the well-known Reynisfjara black sand beach (again paid parking). Totally worth seeing, there were a few of the infamous sneaker waves but you just had to have your wits about you and stay above the high water mark (we didn’t see anyone get dunked). Lots of photo ops with the trolls (basalt columns) in the background and also the hexagonal rock formations. I can see why many movies and TV shows have come here to film, it is like an alien planet landscape.

We then checked into our campsite in Vik, a gem of a small town with a stunning backdrop and the little red-roofed church up high. Basic facilities in the campsite but sufficient for our needs. I had pre-booked the Lava show in Vik for that evening before dinner. It took about 45-50 minutes and started with a very interesting overview of volcanoes and their impact on Icelandic life, especially Katla which erupted in 1918 and almost wiped out the inhabitants of the surrounding area. FYI - for anyone interested in some background reading, I recommend the book ‘Island on Fire’ by Alexandra Witze which tells the story of the apocalyptic eruption of Laki in 1783, which caused devastation for Iceland and much of Europe.. After the introductory film, we got to the main event - fresh (man-made) lava pouring down a channel in front of us to form a red-hot pool. The show host then gave a very informative talk about the nature of lava, different types, how it cools, etc. Highly recommended if you’re in the area.

Next day, we decided to drive over and back to the Glacier Lagoon (Jökulsárlón) in one day - it’s two and a half hours each way so a lot of driving but some very unusual landscapes along the way (rock formations, moss-covered lava fields and more waterfalls). We decided not to park across the bridge at the actual lagoon itself (all the boat rides were booked out anyhow) - instead, we parked for free on the left hand side of the road before the bridge across the lagoon. It’s a short hike to the west side of the lagoon and gives you some impressive views across the entire area with the icebergs floating and the glacier in the distance. In any case, I took a look with my binos across the lagoon and there were no ‘diamonds’ in sight on the Diamond Beach.

OIn the way back towards Vik, we had a glacier hike pre booked up Skaftafell glacier. We got outfitted with helmets, ice picks, boots and crampons by our guides before a 10 minute bus ride to the foot of the glacier. You don’t need a guide (apparently) to approach the glacier but crampons are essential to get up onto it. We spent about 90 minutes up on the actual glacier; our guide from Poland did an excellent job explaining all about glaciers, how the one we are on has retreated so much in the last 30 years and we also chatted about the various natural phenomena that are part and parcel of these majestic beasts (gravel moraine, crevasses, moulins, ice falls, icequakes, etc.). You do need moderate levels of fitness and confidence to take on a glacier hike but it was totally worth it.

After one more night at the Vik campsite, it was back towards Keflavik the following day to return our trusty camper van. We made an early start so we had time to stop in Dyrhólaey to try and spot some puffins (I think we did see some up along the cliff face but we were a long way away). I also did a quick hike up to Kvernufoss as we were passing (my wife went for a kip in the back of the van because she was pretty tired after our hike the previous day). This was one of my personal highlights for the entire trip - because it was early morning, there were hardly any other tourists there so I almost had the place to myself. I was able to get right in behind the waterfall for some fantastic views and a few snaps (any Halo fans watching the TV show will recognize this place, it is incredible). After that it was time to drive back via Selfoss to Reykjavik and then Keflavik to give back the vehicle. Interesting drive that goes up right over the mountain on a new road and then back down again the far side (roadworks still ongoing). We stayed in Keflavik town that evening as we had an early morning flight - our accommodation was basic but quite sufficient and comfortable. We also had one last very nice meal in a local restaurant (the fish and chips basically melted in my mouth).

Some general tips/observances:

1. We got really lucky with the weather - no rain, very light winds, some decent sunshine most days and only a little chilly at night. We had come prepared for the worst with a lot of rain gear, etc. but never had to use it.
2. Iceland is expensive but doable if you stick to a budget. I didn’t exchange any cash and used my card exclusively to pay for everything. If anyone is familiar with Revolut, you can pre-exchange your own currency to Iceland krona and avoid currency exchange fees. No PIN needed at any of the self-service fuel stops I used.
3. We bought supplies at the local supermarkets - Bonus or Kronan (I preferred Kronan). For lunch, it was easier to just buy a ‘Somi’ sandwich or filled roll at a filling station. The Americano coffees you can buy are also decent but the cup isn't very large.
4. Pre-booking some activities is advisable - you have something to aim for every day and if you don’t book ahead, you may be disappointed at the more popular ones when you try to book on the day.
5. You should try the local swimming pools instead of the expensive tourist lagoons. After our glacier hike, we managed to get back to ‘Sundlaugin Vík ‘ before closing time and had a very relaxing soak in the hot tub, pool and sauna. Much cheaper than any lagoon also, less than half price.
6. We didn’t have too much dealings with the locals - I guess they see too many tourists these days. However, everyone was laid-back, courteous and spoke English. A lot of young people were working in the filling stations and restaurants (I swear I saw a 12 year old behind the till in Bonus in Selfoss but that would be illegal I presume).
7. Food and especially alcohol is very expensive. I got myself a few beers in the duty-free arrivals area at the airport and that worked out very well when relaxing in the evening.
8. Very strange having daylight for almost 22 hours per day in early July (it never gets totally dark). If you are a light sleeper, then a sleep mask might be useful.
9. Having the campervan combined with some pre-booked activities worked out well, allowing us plenty of time to roam around on our own schedule but also having something to aim for every day.
10. All the parking fees added up and were a bit of a nuisance to be honest, but I guess they have to raise money to maintain the attractions for tourists.
11. Total spend including flights, campervan hire, fuel, tours/experiences, camp sites, food and drinks was approximately €2500 for both of us, not a bad deal in my opinion.

Overall, a fantastic and very enjoyable first trip to Iceland - only 5 days but we fitted a lot in. Next time I would go somewhere different, maybe the Snaefellsnes peninsula or Westfjords and possibly the ring road itself and highlands some day. And maybe see a whale the next time!

Post,11 Days in Iceland in June - Part 2 (Impressions) LONG,Pinkjasmine17,2024-07-06 16:38:03,"More detailed write up of what we did. Check my previous post for the practicalities and the short itinerary.

A huge huge thank you to this sub for helping me plan my entire Iceland trip - especially scaring me about booking accommodation well enough in advance. It was absolutely amazing to have a place to come to and immediately have access to anything under the sun I'd been wondering about Iceland.

  
Day 1: 

Late arrival. We did not expect how bright it was going to be, nor how cold and windy. Keep your jackets easily available people! Biriyani is the only restaurant open post 9pm and run by a friendly crew.



Day 2: 

Thought we would try to see the erupting volcano because route 431 had recently opened. Unfortunately the view was from too far away and we didn’t get to see much. 



Lunch at the Old Dairy Market Hall in Selfoss. Small portions, the dim sum was good and the pasta too al dente. Drove to Seljalandsfoss and Glujfrabui. Bit of a line to go behind the waterfall at Seljalandsfoss and into the cave at Glujfrabui but not too crowded at 5:30pm (certainly less than the Golden circle). But both waterfalls were beautiful and a fantastic introduction to the beauty we would see in Iceland.



Spent the night at Loa’s Nest in Hella which definitely deserves its sky high reviews. Spotlessly clean, comfortable and super friendly. Got some nice pasta from a large group of Italians who had also booked rooms in the guesthouse.



Day 3: 

Busy day as we drove all the way from Hella to past Jokulsarlon doing Skogafoss, Dyrholaey, and Fjaorarglufur on the way. No puffins at Dyrholaey but the views were good and Fjaorarglufur was a gorgeous and very accessible canyon. They have put down some kind of anti-slip material on the path so it wasn’t slippery at all. 



Sadly did not get to stop in Reynisfjara or Vik at all because this was such a rushed day. In hindsight I would have definitely added another night for this part of the south coast and spent some time in Vik. 



Could not really stop in Skaftafell national park which is a real shame because the drive from Vik to Jokulsarlon is GORGEOUS. The light shining on the glacier, the waterfalls, the steep cliffs - highly recommend giving ample time to enjoy the drive and pull over whenever you want.



Got to Jokulsarlon for the last trip of the day at 5:50pm. It was BITTERLY cold and windy. Definitely needed their over suits and also our jackets, thermals, and preferably a baklava. It was a very unique experience, somewhat marred by my worry about exposing my parents (especially recently recovered from cold dad) to the biting wind and bumpy ride. It's an adventure though! You get to go right up to the mouth of the glacier. Unfortunately no wildlife but the ice was soo blue and beautiful.



Popped down to the beach to see the ice pieces. If there aren’t any at the beach where you are at, then check out the other beach



Post trip we made it to Vagnsstadir guesthouse which was clean, comfortable, and had a good view. Very small sinks in the bathroom and no self cooking facilities though which was kind of a bummer in the middle of nowhere.



Day 4: 

Drove slowly up the East Fjords through the blasting rain and wind. Gorgeous scenery as usual, definitely pulled over a lot. Stopped over at JFS Handicraft to look at the rocks Jon had collected over the years based on a 4.9 google rating. Jon is lovely and so friendly and my regret here is not buying anything from his shop. Definitely worth a quick drop in! 



We took Route 1 for the entire trip - did not attempt Oxi as it was cloudy and I didn’t think the view would be very good any way. Same reason we did not stop at Stokknes - too cloudy.



At Egilssta∂ir we we went to Vok baths. It was bitterly cold (2 C) and windy. Thought I was going crazy for deciding to go for a soak. Was a bit disappointed with the changing room because the lockers weren’t working too well. The pools were lovely though. Long cold walk from the main pool to the “floating” pools. Was initially surprised by how much algae there was in the water in the floating pools but soon got used to it. Fun and friendly atmosphere with people cheering on the people who are brave enough to get into the cold water of the lake. I definitely recommend that you do the cold plunge (I did it 4 times!). It feels euphoric and is the USP of Vok. And wow it is SO scenic. 



Then drove to Seydisfjor∂ur. OMG. The most gorgeous drive and most gorgeous town ever. My favourite in Iceland by far I think. The hills were snow covered and in fact it was snowing lightly when we crossed. For this tropical climate person it was very exciting! When the view opens up to the fjord and the town, we all gasped. And the town is so gorgeous too with the harbour nestled amidst the hills. I am so thankful for whoever in the forum who suggested we stay here rather than in Egillstaddir. Do try to take an early morning or late night walk to soak in the town without any cruise ships.



Day 5: 

Drove from Seydisfjordur to Borgarfjörður Eystri to watch puffins. The drive there was gorgeous. You feel like you’re the only people on the road and in June there were SO many fluffy lambs in the surrounding fields. You drive through some rolling hills, a broad river valley, past some babbling brooks, up some seaside cliffs before spotting the town. 



We arrived at 11:30 so I was afraid we’d missed the puffins but there were SO many about and didn’t show any signs of clearing out for the 1.5 hours we spent there. Truly this must be the best place to see puffins in Iceland and is so worth the drive. They’re literally a few feet away and so chill with humans.



Then we drove over to Lake Myvatn. Decided to skip Dettifoss because of time and also because I was not sure if my parents would be able to do the slippery walk there. 



Instead spent quite a long time at Dimmuborgir lava fields. The place was deserted at around 7pm when we reached and we had a nice meander through the impressive lava formations using our imagination. There are a number of short walking/hiking trails in the area. We took the yellow/red path out and the light blue path back. What they don’t tell you at the beginning is that the light blue path is a “difficult path” which involves a lot of scrambling over lava formations. Great fun and my 60s parents handled it well but the hiking stick was well appreciated.



There weren’t TOO many flies but we certainly thankful for the fly nets we had brought from India. 



Had a quick dinner at Daddi’s Pizza (really appreciated their quick service and the pizzas were delicious) before driving to Husavik. 



Stayed at a lovely AirBnB.



Day 6: 

Had booked the silent whale watching tour with North sailing but due to a boat issue we were on the normal boat. North Sailing were very accommodative in terms of changing the time of our sailing and so quick to respond. Saw some whales fluking. 



Drove over to Akureyri visiting Godafoss on the way. Our AirBnB was on the opposite side of the fjord to Akureyri was a stunning view of the fjord/mountains so spent the evening chilling. Only stepped out to go to the India Curry House in Akureyri which is legit! Checked out the warm waterfall on the way but the water was only lukewarm. This day was summer solstice so spent the night staring at the gorgeous views.



Day 7: 

Stayed until check out at the cottage before doing some shopping at the 66 Degree North outlet store in Akureryi. If you’re interested in the brand I’d recommend this store. Both the prices and the selection was better than other stores we visited, including in Reykjavik. 



Today was a long drive all the way to Stykkisholmur. We started late at around 1pm from Akureyri so we reached only at around 8:30 as we drove through the Trollskagi peninsula as well. Very scenic drive but it adds quite a few hours to your drive so do set out early. 



Didn’t have time to do any of the hot tubs on the way or Hofsos swimming pool because of time and not everyone in the group being equally into the hot springs thing so that’s another thing for next time.



Day 8: 

Morning kayaking in Grundarfjordur near Kirkjufell with Vestur Adventures. Highly recommend them for their customer friendliness. Has a private tour since no one else had booked and the guide was patient enough to give me the info in both English and Spanish so that I could try and improve my Spanish. 



Surprisingly Kirkjufell wasn’t crowded at all despite it being June. Apparently Sundays are the least busy day because everyone is going back. Spent the rest of the day driving around Snaefellsnes. 



Do yourself a favor and stop at Matarlist in Hellissandur for lunch. It’s the cafe in the visitor’s centre so you wouldn’t think it would have such delicious and well crafted food but OMG. Their Skyr desert was one of the best desserts I’ve ever had in my life. We also had the vegan option (amazing) and the apple cake. One of the best restaurant meals I’ve had in a long, long time. 



Took a detour to drive to the Svortuloft lighthouse. You have to drive on gravel roads through lava fields to get there. The detour was worth it for us for the “end of the world” feeling and the solitude. 



Drove to Arnstapi and Hellnar but could not do the walk between the two because it was horribly windy but the view points at Arnstapi are definitely worth the stop. 



Chose to climb up to Raudfeldsgja gorge instead of Ytri Tunga. It an easy climb to the gorge and so cool to walk instead a real gorge. 



Spent the night at Hestaland guesthouse near Borgarnes. Cute, comfortable but a bit cramped.



Day 9: 

I thought we would be sick of waterfalls by now but that was not the case. We were impressed by the breadth of Hraunfossar and the colour of Barnafoss. Helped that it was a bright sunny day as well after a long time. 



Contrary to a lot of people on this forum, I found the settlement centre really boring and not worth the time/money. I liked learning about the early Icelandic settlers but the Egil’s saga exhibition was not my cup of tea at all. There is nothing to read there and everything is by audio guide (cutely some old iPod shuffles) so there was no way of going at our own pace. I would have perhaps preferred the settlement museum in Reykjavik more in hindsight. I wanted more information and less story.

Drove to Eyrarbakki for the night via Reykjavik for a personal commitment. Bakki apartments is right by the sea, spacious and modern. 

Day 10: 

Despite our unusually long day the previous day decided to go to Landmannalaugar as originally planned. Only 208 from the north was open (technically no longer an F road) which was quite good except for about 8 rough kilometres soon after the power station. 



Before turning into the spur F224 towards Landmannalaugar the ranger asked us if we had our reservations and seemed quite surprised that we did (this was only 5 days after the system was put into place). I think they were helping other travellers make their reservations but I can’t be sure. I had had a LOT of trouble booking this in the months before my trip but it worked just fine once I was actually in Iceland and had the car number.



Although the water level was quite low in the morning we decided against crossing the river to the closer parking lot because the batteries for the hybrid are on the bottom. Felt good about this decision as the water level had increased by afternoon. Also the walk between the farther parking lot and the campsite is gorgeous and I enjoyed every minute of it.



Pack your lunch for sure because there is nothing available to eat here.



Bathroom charges are more expensive here at 600kr but at least you spend long enough here to use it maybe twice. One parent wasn’t feeling very up to hiking so two of us climbed the beginning of the orange trail (shortest, 4km round trip) to admire the views of the campsite and the coloured mountains from the top.



Landmannalaugar seriously took my breath away and I did not want to leave. Just the campsite alone is gorgeous even if you do not hike. I definitely want to go back and do a full day hike here. Helped that it was a beautiful sunny day. It is so peaceful and breathtaking. There were a lot of people here but it wasn’t overcrowded by any means. 



Finished our time in Landmannalaugar with a dip in the natural hot springs. Again, sublime experience. It’s very shallow and does get crowded near the hottest water but not to the point that you cannot enjoy yourself. Was hilarious to see a duck swimming by enjoying the hot water. 



Had dinner at Old Dairy Market Hall in Selfoss again. The pad Thai was mediocre but it hit the spot after days of either French fries or Indian instant food.



Day 11: 



Finally, the Golden Circle!



We drove straight to Silfra for a snorkelling tour with Adventure Vikings. I had chosen the wetsuit tour but the guides told me the water was 2 degrees C so I would be more comfortable in a drysuit so drysuit it would be. It was supremely difficult to get into the drysuit.



There were SO many flies, I wished for my fly face net here too. 



The dry suits are VERY restrictive, it was actually very difficult to walk in them. It was like walking in an outfit made out of resistance bands. The water actually didn’t feel cold at all. The most difficult part was controlling my body in the water. It is really difficult to do anything but look straight down - which isn’t the best for looking around or posing for the photos the instructor takes of you. I do recommend people who are into snorkelling do this though. The water is clearer and bluer than you can imagine - I don’t think I’ve ever seen this specific shade of blue in my life before. They ask you to taste the water and it really tasted better than most water I’ve tasted. Do make sure you don’t swallow too much of the floating algae though.



Post Silfra we went to Oxararfoss and walked around. While I know the rock walls we are walking between aren’t really the two continental plates, it still feels cool and beautiful, almost as if you’re walking inside, and not on top of the earth’s crust.



The Golden circle was where we finally saw crowds in Iceland. Hoards and hoards of people after the isolation of the last few days. But still, for someone from India/Hong Kong, the crowds didn’t bother me at all.



We then went to Fridheimar which turned out to be an overhyped disappointment. The tomato soup was just like any other tomato soup I’d had, and while the burrata with Icelandic salt and tomato was delicious, the attitude of the servers was off-putting. We then went to Efstidalur II for ice cream where you can have ice cream looking at the cows. While it was cute to see the calves (who never get to drink their mother’s milk because of the milk needed for the ice cream we are currently eating), the ice cream was good but again, nothing out of the ordinary. 



Finished off with a trip to see the Strokkur geyser and Gulfoss. Both were much more fun and impressive than I had expected. Strokkur was erupting reliably ever 4 minutes when we went and it was great fun to time and anticipate the next eruption. The amount of geothermal energy in Iceland is just insane if you stop to think about it for a second. 



Drove to Reykjavik to finish our day.



Day 12: Reykjavik



Started the day with a quick trip to Laugardalslaug and Braud and Co. What you all say about public pools in Iceland is true! It was fantastic and my biggest regret is not getting up earlier and spending more time here. The water was clean and so warm and lovely and there were so many pools and hot tubs to choose from. I regret not doing public pools in every place we stayed in, especially Akureyri. Braud and Co cinnamon buns were great, and this is coming from someone who dislikes cinnamon buns. 



I had planned this day to explore Reykjavik but since my parents weren’t too interested in museums and we weren’t sure whether the Lava Show would be worth the money. Since we all like natural beauty, we decided to drive around Hvalfjordur (the fjord where Hvammsavik hot springs is located) to get to Akranes to check out Hoppland. Hoppland is a place where you can supposedly jump into the ocean from various heights/a trampoline/off a balance beam. The view on the drive was marvellous and we discovered some “hidden gems” along the way where we were the only tourists. Skipped Hvammsavik because not everyone in the group was as enthusiastic about hot springs but I will DEFINITELY be doing this next time. The setting is INCREDIBLE and I see why people here recommend it so much.



Akranes and Hoppland both turned out to be a disappointment. There weren’t too many places to eat vegetarian food in Akranes so we finally ended up eating cheese pizza at Sbrarro (god bless Sbrarro). Hoppland turned out to be a much smaller endeavour than I imagined and when I went (albeit on a weekday afternoon) it was deserted, and staffed by what looked to be teenagers. I didn’t want to be ageist but when another customer finally showed up, the staff did not bother to oversee the jumping at all, which left a bitter taste in my mouth. If nothing else hang out at the edge with a floatation tube or something to throw to someone in the water? 



Decided not to jump and drove back to Reykjavik where we did a spot of window shopping and checked out the church/rainbow street (nothing on the rainbow street in Seydisfjordur).



And that ended our trip to Iceland. I am definitely already planning my next trip. Think it will be much more hiking and hot springs focused.



There’s just something about being alone in such a vast and dramatic landscape. Primal, almost. And there’s such freedom in being in such a safe place…especially as a woman. In Iceland you can truly breathe. And I miss that already. ",19,6.0
Post,"Go to Borgarfjörður Eystri! While there, take a tour with Puffin Adventures!",Pluviousday,2024-07-06 09:03:32,"First picture is just 1x zoom from the walkways in Borgarfjörður Eysteri. There are so many puffins everywhere and it is well worth the drive. 

While you’re there, I really recommend Puffin Adventures (puffin.is). It’s run by 2 brothers who are super knowledgeable about the geography, wildlife, and culture of the area (they live in the village and were fishermen before starting their business). The rest of the pictures are from our tour but the pictures don’t do it justice. It was the high point of an already phenomenal trip. It’s a little RIB so you feel like you are flying with the puffins and other sea birds when on the ocean and you get to go into all these hidden coves along the coast. We also saw seals and the day before they saw whales, so it is more than just a puffin trip.

The final picture is so you can see all the safety gear in case you’re worried! As someone who gets super sea sick, I would do this again in a heart beat!!!

Final recommendation: stop by the Alfa cafe in the village next to the fishery for the freshest, most delicious fish stew of your life.",46,0.0

Few tips for people that are coming to Iceland.

• Erosion and overturism is a thing in Iceland, don't be the idiot that has to go beyond the barriers to take the perfect Instagram picture. It's disrespectful to other people here and to the site itself. Stay on designated paths and take all your trash with you (even toilet paper and banana peel)

• Please please please dont eat whale or shark while you're here, and dont go to places that serve it. Whale fishing is nowadays mainly for turists and export, don't encourage it.

. Be careful with the wind, it will take you by surprise. Especially with car doors, I had mine slammed into my legs a couple of times and it hurts a lot. Be also careful as it will take your trash away, i don't know how many times I ran after someone's else trash.

That being said enjoy your trip it is an amazing experience, I went for 6 weeks because I thought it would be my only time, but now I know I'll have to come back!",82,9.0
Post,A LONG trip report - 11 Days in Iceland in June - Part 1 (perhaps_,Pinkjasmine17,2024-07-05 18:04:01,"

Edit: Idk why this is getting downvoted...but keeping it up in case it helps anyone else 

Part 1 - Practicals and Itinerary in Brief

Just finished a 11 day trip to Iceland (June 17-June 27 inclusive, exclusive of travel time). Thought I’d write up a trip report both to relive my time and to hopefully give back to this sub, which was invaluable while I was planning. (And yes, I do plan to go back). 

Who: Me (30F) and parents (60s MF) from India

**Visa process:** getting an Iceland visa appointment in India is almost impossible. Most Indian tourists who visit usually get a visa from another Schengen country. I stalked the VFS page for the last two weeks of January until finally getting past their buggy website and managing to book an appointment on Jan 31 for an April 22 appointment for a June 16 departure. I say buggy because sometimes it would show lots of availability but would’t allow me to book and sometimes it would say “no appointments available”.

The visa took exactly a week to arrive. I had submitted a detailed itinerary and no further questions were asked. Did get only a single entry despite having an extensive travel history (quite common for Iceland Schengen visas)

**Flights:** Flew KLM to Amsterdam and then Transavia to Reykjavik. Transavia is one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown in in terms of comfort. But if you book a through connection on the KLM website, your luggage gets checked through and no one hassled us about our luggage. 

**Car rental:** It was a somewhat long walk with our trolleys to BlueCar rental in the cold and the wind. The shuttle stops running at 5. There was no information about how to reach the pick up area so I suggest researching this beforehand. The pick up process with Zerocar was smooth, although I was very disappointed to notice a that our car was a Hybrid Toyota RAV4. I had booked the RAV as it was listed as a 4WD on their website. Only to find a sticker on the car saying “this car is not recommended for driving on highland roads”. I emailed Zero about it, but received no response. 

**Accommodation:** we had booked a mixture of guesthouses and apartments. Since we wanted to accommodate three people and have a private bathroom, there weren’t too many options and most were €200-250 a night, with our cheapest accommodation being around €180. We booked about 5 months in advance, but maybe it would have been better to book earlier. OTOH, when I was trying to reschedule my trip a week out, I still managed to find something for most nights, albeit not as nice/much more expensive. Most places were quite good in terms of quality and comfort. Good quality linen almost everywhere which was a pleasant surprise. And the hot water didn’t stink as much as I had feared. 

**Food:** We are vegetarians and somewhat picky ones. None of us eat egg unless disguised (not a moral thing, we just hate the smell) and for us, random raw vegetables thrown onto a croissant does not an adequate meal make. I had heard a lot about grocery store or gas station food in Iceland but it was very disappointing.

Most gas stations I saw did not have any vegetarian options in stock. Maybe the trick is to reach early in the morning and stock up but **do not expect a vegetarian sandwich if you show up at lunch time.** Even if they had something, it would be only one option and quite sad. I am used to the vegetarian options in countries like the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands where the options are plentiful. Iceland is not like that. 

Most restaurants, even Indian restaurants, have only 1 or max 2 vegetarian options. The exception to this was Fridheimar but didn’t enjoy this for other reasons.

If you’re vegetarian, I HIGHLY recommend bringing your own food. We brought instant food from India (MTR FTW) and heated them up either with our own hotpot or with the facilities in the hotel. It turned out to be cheaper, easier, more economical, and delicious. 

**Toilets:** Spotless but you have to pay a LOT of money (200-300 Kr usually) to use them. 

**Parking:** 700-1000 at most places in the South coast that ask for parking fees. In the south coast it was mostly through the Parka app that had some trouble accepting my card at the beginning but then worked okay. I think Seljalandfoss has a different system that was down when we visited.  Please make sure you pay for parking as your car number is recorded when you enter the parking lot.

Don’t mind paying for parking or toilets but not both. Don’t remember now which sites charged for both but I remember it irritating me at the time. There was recently a very useful post about parking in Iceland.

Post,"9 day trip report, itinerary",PretendAnywhere,2024-07-04 19:51:04,"
We have just come back from our first, but surely not the last trip in Iceland, and I'd like to share the itinerary along with some pictures and impressions. It worked quite well for us, a couple in their mid-forties, reasonably fit and active. I won't mention all the things we did, just the main ones.

Arrival, Keflavik - Reykjavik - Vik

Landed at 9am, grabbed a car and drove to Reykjavik downtown for lunch and a walk. Spent 2-3 hours there. Then drove to the guesthouse off Vik, visited a few attractions along the coast beginning with Seljalandsfoss. It was quite difficult to drive that much through the rain and fog after a sleepless night, and although the stops helped a lot to shake off the sleep, I won't recommend doing this.

Day 2, Vik - Jokulsarlon - Vik

Drove to the Ice lagoon to take the Zodiac boat tour.  I feel strong aversion to guided tours and we don't do them if it can be helped, but this one was quite good. It didn't feel crowded at all and the guide was great, without usual chattering and bullshitting. On the way back we did a hike in Skaftafell park. It looked like most people only got there to see the waterfall, which wasn't bad, but the best part was the overlook above the glacier.  Other notable stops on that day were at the Diamond beach, Fjallsarlon lagoon, Hofskirkja and Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon.

Day 3, Vik - Vestmannejar - Selfoss

So we took the ferry with the car to Vestmannaeyjabær. There we went straight to the southern peninsula for the puffins and walked the circle trail along the coast. Then hiked the Eldfell volcano, had lunch, visited a few other sites, took the ferry back and drove to a cabin off Selfoss. Fun fact. There are no gas stations for 80 km to the west of Vik, the closest one being on the island. The refuel light appeared shortly after we started driving, so you can imagine our anxiety on approaching the ferry.

Day 4, Selfoss, Thorsmork

We took a mountain bus from Brú base near Seljalandsfoss at 9am to Volcano huts. There we climbed Valahnjúkur overlook and from there went to Fimmvorduhals trail and followed it up hoping to reach Móði crater and turn back. The weather changed every 15 minutes from tolerable to ghastly with strong wind and hail. When we got to the stony plateau, we met a group with a guide, who talked us out of finishing the planned hike, so we turned back before the final climb and took the bus back to Brú base. The total hiking distance on that day was about 9mi/15km.

Day 5, Selfoss, lazy day

We drove to Haifoss in the morning with a few stops along the way then went back to the cabin for a nap. Then went to Gullfoss, Geysir, Thingvellir and finally to the Sky lagoon by 8pm. It was packed, but we enjoyed it a lot nevertheless.

Day 6, Selfoss, Landmannalaugar

Went to Landmannalaugar and did a short hike across the lava fields climbing the colored mountain, about 4 miles total. They introduced parking reservations this year, and the ranger at the entrance did actually stop every vehicle and checked the reservation. Our Dacia Duster managed the river crossing before the second parking lot easily.

Got home for a nap and later, at about 9pm drove to Hveragerði for a hike to Reykjadalur bathing area. I can't say we enjoyed it, mostly because of the gale blowing into the face all the time. The bathing area was crowded despite nasty weather and late hours. I took a dip just to check the bucket while my wife waited on the shore, gloves, hat, two hoods and scarf on.

Day 7, Selfoss - Snæfellsnes

The wind didn't stop on that day, so we decided to skip the planned hike to the Glymur waterfall and went shopping and to the Hvammsvik hot springs instead. Having experienced so much cold and wind on the previous days we figured we deserved a few 66 North garments, so we stopped at the factory outlet in Reykjavik, and while it was still overly expensive, managed to buy something good. Hvammsvik was great, quiet and beautiful. I enjoyed it much more than Sky lagoon, especially the steam room and swimming in the fjord.

Then we went to the rented cottage in Snæfellness, went to Kirkjufell to take obligatory pictures before going to sleep.

Day 8, Snæfellness

We basically took the road along the coast counterclockwise making about a dozen stops with short walks on the way. It's an extremely beautiful area, and pictures usually don't do it justice. 

Day 9, Snæfellsnes - Keflavik

We only had a few hours before the flight, so we dropped into Costco, just for fun, to compare stuff and prices to the ones back home. If you are interested, steaks and lamb are significantly, at least 2 times more expensive than in the US. Then we went to Krýsuvík to see more geysers, had lunch in Garður by the lighthouse, grabbed Subway for dinner on the plane, dropped the car and took off.

I summed up the expenses, so here they are in US dollars excluding airfare and souvenirs.

lodging 1442
tours and hot springs 822
car rental 472
restaurants and bars 484
fuel 360
groceries 306
beer and wine 180
ferry 121
museums 68
parking 38

total 4293

Well, Iceland is expensive, but I don't feel like our trip was. I made all the bookings 5-6 months ahead, probably getting better prices, all the places we stayed in had a kitchen, so we cooked most of the meals ourselves, or even didn't make anything and just had bread/cheese/salami with wine and fresh vegetables and fruit. I believe we had only 5-6 meals out, the best being from the Röstin restaurant in Garður and the worst - a pizza from the Brothers brewery on Vestmannaeyjar. All wine and beer was bought at the duty free shop right after the passport control. Fuel is expensive, and while we had a small Dacia Duster diesel car, driving 2250km/1400 miles should cost something. The most expensive activity was the mountain bus to and from Thorsmörk, but I'd say overall we got great returns no matter the costs. So I'm hooked, I am already planning the next trip!",69,9.0
Post,Wild Animal Situation?,New-Path-6269,2024-07-04 07:18:42,"What is the wild animal scene like in Iceland? what are your recommendations for seeing large, friendly, approachable, wild animals in nature? I would love to hug a walrus or a puffin, but even a high five with any mid-large size wild animal would be great.

Maybe I'd start with some food. I hugged the leg of a wild elephant in corbet park in this manner. and a stork in a park in belfast. i almost hugged a wild coyote in LA in this manner but it ended up running away.

My point was more that Iceland doesn't really have much in the way of wildlife.  It being a pretty new island, most of the animals on it were imported.  I think the puffin, seals, and Arctic fox are the only ""wild"" animals. 

Honestly, paying for a horse riding adventure might be your best bet, as the horses are pretty free range too, and so they're very spirited.",1,
Post,July 7-day itinerary check!,AGhostDoingABadJob,2024-07-03 22:44:37,"Hi everyone,

I’ve greatly appreciated the advice and guidance shared on this subreddit; hopefully my itinerary reflects that! My husband and I are visiting Iceland for the first time for a week (7/7 - 7/14); the trip came together last minute, so I want to make sure we’re not being too ambitious and leaving time for exploration. 

We’re in our early forties, and top priorities for us are seeing puffins/birds, enjoying nature (geothermal activity, unique rocks and minerals), and taking a moderate hike or two. We are afraid of heights, so I tried to optimize the route to avoid anything to cliff-like or roads without guard rails. We will have a rental car with wifi and full liability coverage. We don’t need a lot of excursions or planned activities, and I want to leave time to not stress about rushing from A to B.

What I would love feedback on:
- Are there any stretches of the trip that feel miscalculated? (E.g., a really long drive, doing things out of order)
- Are there any red flags re: steep cliffs or scary roads?

Post,"Post-Trip Iceland Itinerary thoughts, activities, and prices. ",snoopy_90s,2024-07-03 00:17:38,"I just got back from an amazing trip to Iceland June 20- June 30. I went with my husband, 2 teens, and my toddler that is almost 3. Feel free to ask me anything. When I was researching I wanted to find information like this so I laid out everything we did, prices,  and my thoughts in case it might help anyone else with their trip planning. I decided to not do the whole ring road because since I was travelling with a toddler I preferred to have a base for a few days and then go to places from there. I booked everything in late April and had trouble finding accommodations for 5 people in general that weren't crazy expensive or inexpensive but more rough. 

I am usually more into trying new foods when I go to new places but I decided to allocate our budget for activities rather than for food for this trip. Groceries were much more reasonable than I expected. Most of our meals were cooked in our airbnb which allowed us to save on time and money. 

Roundtrip Flights on Delta from Orlando for 5 people: $2050 ($410 each)

Car Rental- Dacia Jogger 10 Days $1096 Zero car rental full coverage. (I usually don't opt for full coverage but I was glad we did in Iceland. It kept me much more at ease and less worried)

Gas $200 We basically made it a point to stop at Costco for gas as were driving through to get to our next stops. 

Additional Misc Expenses (Coffees, drinks, snacks, etc): $100

Total: $9665. I would round it up to around 10k for 2 adults, 2 teenagers, and 1 toddler. 

|Day |Activity |Total Price|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Lunch at Costco |$35|We were tired after our long flight and had to wait until 2pm to check in to our airbnb. We saw the costco and decided to stop in to walk around and grab some food at the food court. We got the burger which was okay, the hot dog, box of pizza, and some coffee and ice cream. It was all pretty good but nothing special. |
|1|Grocery Shopping at Bonus|$85|We went to bonus after checking in and bought stuff to make dinner for the next 2 days and breakfast. I got stuff like bread, ham, cheese, ground beef, pasta. The prices are pretty similar to the united states except for the meats which seem to be about 20% more. Some things like butter, and produce seemed to be cheaper.|
|1|Safrai Quads  ATV (2 people)|$342 (2 people)|We enjoyed this atv tour. It was actually a lot longer than we expected (3 hours). 2 hours were spent just riding. I expected more stops but there was only one stop. We were still tired and jet lagged so I don't think we enjoyed it fully. They gave us all the gear we needed to stay warm. It rained quite a bit but it was very nice driving through all the landscapes. |
|1-3|3 Nights at an Airbnb in Reykjavik |$787|We stayed at an airbnb that had 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. It was a 4th floor walk up in a ordinary apartment building. Nothing special but well equipped. |
|2|Perlan Museum|$108|I purchased a family ticket for all of us. The museum was nice and well worth it. This day was very rainy so it was nice to not be outside in the rain and we felt it was a nice introduction to everything iceland had to offer. We are not really museum people but we still spent around 3 hours there going to the different shows and walking around. |
|2|Perlan Museum Ice Cream|$30|A few of us got ice cream in the ice cream shop. It was pretty good. |
|2|Lunch at KFC|$65|We got lunch at kfc leaving the museum. We wanted something fast since we were short on time. The food was actually pretty good. |
|2|Blue Lagoon|$280 (3 tickets+ toddler free)|We really enjoyed our time at the blue lagoon. It was touristy but it was actually very clean and organized. The lagoon was at full capacity when we went but we never felt crowded. You could always find a place to be alone. The only crowded areas were the mask bar and the beverage bar. It was nice and warm and we spent around 2 hours in the lagoon and around 3 hours there. The highlight was the drive there. Parts of the road were still showing smoke and the desolate landscape of black volcanic rock was beautiful. |
|3|Laugarvtan Fontana|$69 (3 adult tickets)|This activity was okay. The process of baking the bread was pretty cool but it was rainy and windy and our guide had a very strong accent and didn't seem to understand a few questions the guests had. The bread was yummy. I wouldn't do the tour but I would stop in and sample the bread that you can buy at their shop for 500isk. |
|3|Bruarfoss, Geysir, Kerio Crater|Parking fees around $12|We did these stops on the golden circle. They were nice but very touristy. Mostly just quick stops at each. |
|3|Fridheimar Tomato and Horse Farm Lunch|$98 (4 adults, child free)|The soup and bread was delicious. The ambiance was very nice but the service was not very good. The host was super rude and the server was just okay. We all did the buffet. After our late lunch we were all jet lagged and tired so we just went home. |
|4|Thingvellir National Park|$7 Parking |We checked out of our airbnb and drove to this park. We were there around 3 hours. We parked by where the snorkeling excursions were departing. We walked to the top to the observation area, then back down past a few water falls, and the church. Overall we had a nice time here just walking around and taking in the landscapes. |
|4|Pylsuvagninn (Selfoss)|$45|We stopped for hot dogs entering selfoss. We each had the deep fried hot dog with cheese and fries. |
|4|Bonus (Selfoss)|$78|We stopped at the bonus in selfoss on the way to Hella to buy groceries for our airbnb. I bought stuff to make some chicken tacos for dinner, breakfast, yogurt, drinks, and snacks for the next 2 days. |
|4-5|Airbnb Hella on Horse Farm|2 nights $987|We splurged a bit for this very nice modern airbnb on a horse farm in Hella. It was very nice and beautiful. It was right in the horse farm and we could see horses all day. It had 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. |
|5|Vik Lava Show|3 people $114|The show was very informative and well executed. I thought it was money well spent. |
|5|Lunch at The Soup Company |$92|We got three bowls of a soup and a creamy pasta that one teen and toddler shared. The soups were very delicious and hearty. We were already there for the lava show so it was convenient and delicious |
|5|Yoda Cave and Black Sand Beach |Parking $7|I saw there was yoda cave and since my husband is a huge star wars fan we we went. We actually spent a few hours there and walked all the way to the top of the hill and down the beach. There wasn't a lot of people. We were able to reach the entrance of the cave with our regular car. You don't need a 4x4 (in summer) like a lot of reviews mentioned.|
|5|Seljalandsfoss|Parking $7|I loved this area. The main waterfall was beautiful. The rain had just cleared and the sun had come out so there was a beautiful rainbow. The last secret waterfall was my favorite. It was inside a cavern and we had an amazing time walking through the water and climbing the giant rock. We got some amazing pictures in there. One of my favorite memories of the trip. We were in the area around 2 hours.  |
|5|Grill 66|$64|It was late after the waterfall and one of the only things open was the grill 66 on the way back to hella we got some burgers and hot dogs and ate them inside the gas station. They were pretty good and hit the spot after a long day. |
|6|Pylsuvagninn (Selfoss) |$52 |We stopped here for hot dogs again driving through selfoss. (Everyone was craving them again) |
|6|Bonus Borganes |$118|This day we mostly just drove. We stopped at Bonus for groceries for the next 2 days. Our airbnb had a grill so we bought chicken, pork chops, ground beef, hot dogs, corn, breakfast items, and snacks to have for the next 2 dinners and breakfasts. |
|6-7|Airbnb Cabin Husafell |$552|We stayed in a cabin that had 2 bedrooms, bathroom and hot tub right in the main husafell area. It was very nice and peaceful. |
|7|Hraunfossar|Parking $7|This waterfall was nice but by this point the teens were a little over seeing waterfalls. It was nice but we were only there about and hour. |
|8|Into the Glacier Tour |$430 (4 adults 1 toddler)|I found a coupon code only that saved me 20%. This tour was pretty cool. A bus drove us from husafell to the base camp where we boarded the big vehicle to the glacier. They gave us what we needed to help us walk and we spent about an hour walking through an ice cave. Our guide was nice but I wish he gave us more time for pictures. The whole tour was about 3 hours and was a unique experience. They even gave us a sled for our toddler to sit in that we could drag around. |
|9|Viking Sushi Boat Tour|$205 (2 adults, 2 teen, 1 toddler)|We woke up early and drove from Husafell to Stykkishólmur. This tour was probably one of my favorite. I wish we had more time Stykkishólmur. The boat took us around the islands and we saw a ton of puffins and different birds. The boat managed to get so close. It was also a beautiful blue sky day so it made for an amazing day for a boat ride. They pulled a bunch of seafood from the bottom of the ocean and we feasted on some delicious fresh raw scallops. The whole experience was around 2 hours and I found it worth it.  After the boat ride we went to the little island across from the port and walk around and took pictures. It was very beautiful. |
|9|Fish and Chips at Port |$88|These fish and chips were a highlight of my trip. They were by far the best I have every had anywhere in the world. They had this curry tartar sauce that was addicting and the fries were salt and vinegar. I know I will be dreaming of these. |
|9|Selvallafoss|Free|This was the most beautiful place that had the most beautiful landscape and waterfall. It didn't even look or feel real. There was  small free parking lot. We spent about 2 hours here just taking pictures. The sky was perfect and it was just so surreal. There was also a bunch of sheep just walking around. |
|9|Dominos|$51|We got to the city super late and dominos was open. We got 2 specialty pizzas, breadsticks, and a 2 liter soda. The pizza was very good and much less heavy and greasy than here in the states. |
|9-10|Midgardur by Center Hotels|$886 (2 rooms for 2 nights)|This hotel was okay. It was very close to the center and had a small side street with free parking which was nice. |
|10|Brauð & Co|$42|I picked up 5 cinnamon rolls, coffee and croissants for us to eat for breakfast. The cinnamon rolls were delicious. |
|10|Mainstreet Souvenir Shopping |$150|We walked around the main street for a few hours and bought a few little souvenirs like tshirts, puffin stuff, etc. |
|10|Make a wool monster private work shop |$162 (2 people)|My husband and teen went to this workshop. They had a very nice time making their own wool monster. They left with unique monsters and big smiles so I would say it was worth it. It was less than an hour. |
|10|Reykjavik Chips|$98|We had a late lunch early dinner here. We got some burgers an fish and chips. They were all good (not as good as the fish and chips prior). |
|10|Bonus|$66|We made a final trip to bonus to buy some candies and chocolates to bring home. We also bought some pre packed sandwiches to munch on since we had  a early dinner. Our flight was early the next morning. |",30,11.0

Post,Is 2 days in vestmannaeyjabaer a good idea for end of july? ,fifialoemera,2024-07-02 00:41:36,My airbnb host cancelled my reservation in Selfloss last minute and I’m looking for affordable places to stay along our route going east. I suppose this is why I shouldn’t  have chosen a host with no reviews.  So I could see puffins and do some hiking? I don’t  know if it makes sense to go to an even smaller island.  I wanted to experience Reykjavik on our last 2 days of our 1 week trip.  Basically I wanted to stay in a small town and see the surrounding area then go hiking around Kirkjubaejarklaustur  then drive back and enjoy Rekyjavik.  ,1,9.0

Post,Help with itinerary?,NoExamination7645,2024-07-01 21:09:42,"Hi everyone!
 
My wife and I are planning a very short trip to Iceland this week, and I wanted to get any thoughts/advice on our tentative itinerary. I have included all potential stops, but we are definitely wanting to weed it down to fewer stops or add better ones. I based this off of information from Google, but I trust you all more with what is/isn't worth it!
 
Something to note - due to an injury we want to avoid too much unnecessary walking/hiking, which I know may be difficult in Iceland, but essentially it may not be worth it to see certain sights if they aren't easily accessible.
 
We also have a bunch of waterfalls listed, but probably can narrow down to only one or two.
 
Day 1:
Sky Lagoon (in the morning)
Golden Circle
Thingvellir National Park
Geysir Hot Spring Area
Brúarfoss Waterfall
Gullfoss Waterfall
Reykholt
Kerid Crater
Day 2:

·       Possibly a food tour in the morning

·       Reservation at Friðheimar at 1:30pm (may skip if we need more time to drive south)

·       Head to South Coast

o   Seljalandsfoss

o   Gljúfrabúi Waterfall

o   Seljavallalaug Swimming Pool

o   Skogafoss waterfall

o   Kvernufoss Waterfall

o   Sólheimasandur Airplane Wreck

o   Solheimajokull Glacier

o   Vik (overnight)

Day 3:

·       Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach

·       Dyrhólaey

·       Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon

·       Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach (might be too far)

·       Possibly a puffin tour?

·       Driving back to Reykjavik/flight home the following morning

 

Then for food options, we are looking for some affordable options that are still yummy and some authentic food for sure, we are thinking of some of the following:

Reykjavik

·       Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur

·       Noodle Station

·       Reykjavik Chips

·       Sandholt Bakery

·       Hlemmur Mathöll

·       Krua Thai

·       Icelandic Street Food

Vik

· Halldorskaffi

· Smidjan Brugghus

· Suður-Vík

· Víkurskáli",0,2.0
Post,Car/how much time to visit Westman Islands,doUknowthemuffinman,2024-07-01 19:43:34,"Hello all, 

I'll be visiting very soon and booked an evening puffin/wildlife tour on Westman Islands. I know it's suggested on here to bring a car and spend the night there, but 

1. I'm lodging in Hella so I was hoping it could remain a day trip (unless the weather disrupts the ferry schedule of course). 
2. I believe the tour guide drives us around to certain places for wildlife viewing. 
3. I'm kind of nervous about driving a rental onto a ferry, I've seen it done but have personally never done it before. Sometimes it voids insurance too? At least it did in another country. 

Would it be a terrible idea to go without a car? Also, if the tour is in the evening, when would be a good time to arrive on the island? I don't have to see EVERYTHING on the island in one trip, I might want to come back and stay overnight in the future (this is my second visit to Iceland :)). Thanks!",1,3.0
Comment,,theyreflockingthsway,2024-07-01 21:10:18,"You certainly don't need a car to do the puffin tour - that'll leave from right near the harbor. You can walk up to the volcano museum pretty easily from the harbor, and there are big lava flows and hiking paths behind the museum it's easy to explore on foot. So I don't think you really need to bring the car unless walking for a couple of hours isn't comfortable for you. 

I might consider going on a midday ferry and getting there in the afternoon? Then you could walk/hike for several hours, have dinner, and take the puffin tour after (depending on when it leaves). 

Also we really liked staying in Hella. There's not much to it, but we found it quite charming. The municipal pool is lovely.",1,
Comment,,doUknowthemuffinman,2024-07-02 00:21:42,"Thanks for the info! I'm looking forward to Hella, the only other thing I've booked so far is the caves, puffins were my main priority this trip. 

I stayed in Reykjavik last time but feel like I wasted most of the trip driving to go see the things we were interested in. Next visit I want to stay further north or near Vatnajökull!",1,

Post,2nd Trip to Iceland - First time around the whole Ring Road - 15 full days,ameliachester,2024-06-28 22:06:33,"I have my second trip to Iceland pretty much certainly planned, and everything that needs booking had been booked - it's happening in a few weeks - but just checking in for your valuable advice and feedback especially concerning the Trollaskagi Peninsula and Isafjordur and any great eats along the way. My partner and I were in Iceland last April (I wrote about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/132wisq/april_1322_trip_report_long_and_detailed/)) and we have already seen much of south Iceland, and Snaefellsnes Peninsula. We like to not be too rushed and if we have to drive long distances, we like to break up the drives with lots of little stops. I know we are not spending enough time in the Westfjords (that will have to be our third trip!) but we really wanted to dip our toes in without being overly ambitious, so I am mostly interested in short stops/viewpoints along our route or close to/in Isafjordur. And just generally - too ambitious? Too little/too much time at some of these places? Thank you so much (again) for your insight!

Post,Itinerary Feedback (12 nights Aug/Sept),saras415,2024-06-27 14:25:25,"Hey all,

My boyfriend and I are currently planning our first trip to Iceland for late Aug/early Sept 2024. This itinerary is still in the works but wanted to get some initial feedback as to anything we should be sure to add (or recommended to eliminate), and also the timing/pacing of the trip since if we need to adjust any hotel reservations we want to do that sooner rather than later for availability and price reason. 

A couple of notes about us - we are generally quicker pace ""see as much as possible"" people, but will want a couple slightly slower paced days to break up the pace a bit. Neither of us are typically early risers, so despite the plethora of advice out there to the contrary, it is pretty unlikely we will leave the hotel before 10am-11am most days, and will likely want at least a couple slow mornings to sleep in a bit later. We are doing the ring road but are not wanting to move hotels every single night so minimizing the number of single-night stays even if it means a small bit of backtracking driving-wise (this also allows for a couple of those later sleep-in days without the pressure of early hotel check out times). Pretty comfortable with long drives - I have personally done 16+ hour drives multiple times while moving cross-country in the states before - and with driving in snowy conditions (although hopefully the latter won't be much of a factor in late Aug/Sept). Targeting solely hotel rooms w/ private bathrooms. Generally we do a fairly quick breakfast (pastry/bagel/granola bar) and light lunch (sandwich or quicker cafe etc.), but will do nicer sit-down meals for dinner where possible. Will likely do some shorter hikes (eg. 1-2hrs range, nothing super strenuous) as needed to see certain sights but not looking to do lengthy all-day or overnight hikes. Definitely want to fit in the majority of ""can only do it here"" experiences, as well as taking advantage of the multitude of hot springs for relaxation after long days. 

  
Day 1: Arrive 9:30am (red eye flight from NYC); pick up rental car (Jeep Renegade). Keep the day low-key with some time to rest after hotel check-in. Explore Reykjavik including Hallgrimskirkja Church, Rainbow Street, Sun Voyager metal sculpture, street art. Early dinner around 5:30 or 6pm. 8:00pm Sky Lagoon & stay through sunset 

Day 2: Sleep in morning to rest up and recover from jet leg. 1:30pm pickup near hotel for ""Inside the Volcano"" tour (2pm-8pm). Late dinner after returning to hotel

Day 3: Golden Circle. Depart hotel around 10am. Thingvellir National Park, Geysir, Gulfoss Waterfall and Kerid Crater. Friðheimar is booked up for res that day but potentially try to stop by their wine bar along the way. Dinner back in Reykjavik sometime around 7:30 or 8pm

Day 4: Snaefellsness Peninsula. Depart hotel around 10am. I think I've crammed too much into this day so let me know if you have recs for priorities or things we should consider eliminating! Gerðuberg Basalt Cliffs; Bjanarfoss Waterfall; Búðakirkja Church (Black Church); Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge; Gatklettur Rock Formation; Lóndrangar & Malariff Lighthouse; Djúpalónssandur Beach; Saxhóll Crater; Svörtuloft Lighthouse; Svodufoss Waterfall; Kirkjufell Mountain. Eat dinner somewhere along the route when we get hungry (any recs?). Stay at hotel right by Kirkjufell Mountain. 

Day 5: Depart hotel around 11am. Long drive day Kirkjufell to Akureyri. Consider detour up to Hvitserkur Rock Formation depending on how we are feeling in terms of the long drive. Any other stops we should be sure not to miss along the way? Also there appear to be 2 diff routes with similar drive times in google maps - it defaults to 56 down to 54 and back onto ring road 1 - is this the best option despite it seeming to go a bit South out-of-the-way? After hotel check-in and dinner in Akureyri, visit Forest Lagoon (8pm)

Day 6: Sleep in and rest up morning - depart hotel around 1pm. Explore Lake Myvatn Area. Godafoss Waterfall. Skútustaðagígar, Grjótagjá Cave, Hverir Geothermal Area. Other stops time dependent. Dinner in Husavik. Geosea Geothermal Sea Baths (7:30pm). Drive back to hotel in Akureyri hotel to sleep. 

Day 7: Depart hotel around 11am checkout time. Drive Akureyri to Seydisfjordur. Stops at Viti Crater, Dettifoss Waterfall, Stuðlagil Canyon. If there is time, stop at Borgarfjörður Eystri to see if the puffins are still there (might be too late in the season - is this spot still worth stopping if no puffins?) - otherwise save for Day 8. Dinner in Egilsstadir or Seydisfjordur. Vök Baths. 

Day 8: Depart hotel around 10am or 11am. Explore Seydisfjordur town and have lunch before leaving town. If puffins are still there, backtrack to Borgarfjörður Eystri if did not visit on day 7. Otherwise, skip that and directly onward along route 1 south through the East Fjords. Stop at Vestrahorn. Any other stops we should be sure to make? Aim to arrive at hotel in Höfn by 7pm or so. Dinner at Pakkhús. 

Day 9: Depart hotel approx 11am and drive to Jökulsárlón. 1pm Vatnajökull Glacier Blue Ice Cave Tour (approx 3 hours/ return around 4pm). Explore Diamond Beach. 6pm Boat tour on the Glacier Lagoon. Dinner either near Jökulsárlón or back in Höfn. If there is time/not too late, potentially visit Hoffell Hot Tubs. 

Day 10: Depart hotel around 11am. Rive from Höfn to Vik. Svínafellsjökull Glacier; Svartifoss Waterfall; Stjórnarfoss Waterfall; Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon; Gönguleið um Eldhraun. Dinner at Black Crust Pizza in Vik. 

Day 11: Likely a later start/mellower sleep-in morning. Visit Hjörleifshöfði “Yoda Cave”; Vikurfjara; Reynisfjara Beach & Reynisdrangar; Dyrholaey. Explore Vík. Is the lava show cheesy or worth it? \*\*Alternate option - shift these sights to day 10 & 12 and do a day trip to Landmannalaugar (would this be worth it to see if we don't want to do more than a short hike?). If we go that route, is it possible to fit all of these sights (excluding the Lava show) into Day 10 & 12 as that fit within those drives? 

Day 12: Depart hotel approx 10am. Drive from Vík to Keflavík. Stop at Skógafoss & Kvernufoss Waterfalls; Seljalandsfoss Waterfall & Gljufrabui Canyon. Is it worth stopping in Hella for the caves tour? Drive to Keflavík Hotel. Blue Lagoon (8pm)

Departure Day: Early morning - return rental car. 11:25am flight departure. ",1,2.0
Post,Searching for puffins ,PlethoraofPuffins,2024-06-27 12:04:52,"Is it possible to see puffins in Southern Iceland or Reykjavik? 

We are currently staying near the Glacier lagoon with more day left before heading back to Reykjavik. 

Borgarfjorour Eystri is 5 hours away. The puffin viewing looks amazing there, but not sure it’s doable or worthwhile in one day.

Comment,,Adamantium-Aardvark,2024-06-27 12:29:00,"- Dyrholaey is accessible by car on the south coast. 

- Heimaey is an island and requires a ferry. 

- Ingolfshöfði requires a tour with a tractor ride across a large beach and a hike up onto an island. Pricey but people seem to enjoy it. 


The cool thing about Borgarfjarðarhöfn is that you can just drive right up to the harbor, and walk up a short staircase and see the puffins right up close at no extra cost. The only “cost” is the long drive there. It makes sense if you’re doing the ring road and stopping in Egisslatdir, since it’s only an hour drive from there. But I wouldn’t do a 5 hour drive each way just to go to this spot, personally.",5,
Comment,,MinervasOwlAtDusk,2024-06-27 13:44:56,"Heimaey is part of the Westman Islands. It’s about a 2-2.5 hour ferry trip from Reykjavik, then a 10 minute drive (if you have a car) to the point with all the puffins. There’s a terrific volcano museum there, too. This option is cheaper, but if you don’t have a car, it’s about a 30 minute hike to the puffins (which is fine, except it’s often in cold rain, so be sure to have rain gear).

Another option—there are puffin boat tours that leave from Reykjavik. This would be somewhat more expensive.",2,
Comment,,Trivial-P-Happiness,2024-06-27 19:25:01,"Borgarfjörður eystri was heaven for me, but that is a long trek and you should try to going the morning or evening. The Westman Islands are also incredible and worth the ferry trip alone, but again you want to go morning or evening. We were at the puffin lookout on the westman islands around 8pm and only saw a couple. A few hours late we saw tons coming back to nest elsewhere on the island. And Dyrhólaey closes at 7pm. You should be able to see some at Reynisfjara Beach because you can go later in the evening. As already mentioned, the Ingólfshöfði Puffin tour is another option closer to you.",1,
Comment,,nsr715,2024-06-28 00:53:02,"I just did the Ingólfshöfði Puffin Tour last week and it was fantastic! It’s not too far from the Glacier Lagoon if you still have time to squeeze it in. The guide will take you right to where the nests are and there are thousands of puffins there.

It was incredibly close to the Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon. Loved the scenery, the knowledgeable and friendly guide, the tractor ride, the fact that the business has been family owned for generations, the gorgeous cliffs, and most of all— the plethora of puffins.

Comment,,miteshm79,2024-07-07 22:46:48,"Just got back! Trip was great and the landscape is beyond beautiful - no pictures do any justice to it. We were more or less on track with the itinerary that I shared. I also shared it with my kids in advance, and they religiously followed it and kept me in check too! Only additional things to share

Day 1 - from feedback on this post, I switched Blue Lagoon to the last day. So only did the Snaefellsness peninsula - by 4 pm kids were asleep as jet lag kicked and was a good call.

Day 2 - Followed the itinerary as is - including the free ranger tour at 10 AM to the thingvellur national park. Ended the day 1 hour later than planned but - didn’t matter. The glamping hotel was an amazing experience.

Day 3 - Followed the itinerary, but fumbled with my navigation and so missed out on Dyrholaey beach. But spent more time after lava show (must see!) at the Black beach

Day 4 - Followed the itinerary within the noted time slots. Also, added a stop at Fjallsjokull glacier view to the itinerary. At the Glacier lagoon - saw a note that the park rangers do a free tour at 10 am and 3 pm - we missed the slots, but sharing for reference of future planners.

Day 5/6 - Followed my itinerary as it is. Yes, drive back to Vik was long but enjoyable. On Day 6 - we visited the puffin lookout at westman island around 7 pm - and there were not many - and so went back on Day 7 early in the morning. Overall felt that the overnight stay at Westman island was not worth it - Should have planned the day to be back on mainland.

Day 7 - Reached Reykjavík an hour earlier, and covered all key spots in the city vey easily.

Day 8 - We did Blue Lagoon on this day - was better than doing it on day 1  with jet lag, but felt a bit of a time crunch and so ended it earlier than the kids wanted to be in the lagoon (we still spend over 3 hours in the lagoon)!

Overall, extremely happy to have seen iceland - and very satisfied with the advance planning. And of course, all the great feedback from redditors that  helped validate/tweak it!",2,

Post,5 Astonishing Lessons That Erupted From Iceland,n1jimmy,2024-06-24 15:39:49,"Iceland opened my eyes to a better way of life.

The scenery and attractions that draw millions annually fully deliver on their promise. But between all the monumental mountains that pierce the sky, the people and culture left the strongest impression. The country buzzed with community, health, and enjoying the present.

Instead of a stuffed puffin or volcanic face cream, I brought home ideology as a souvenir. Here’s why.

* Delicious and healthy food
* A deep sense of community
* Commitment to the country
* Balanced attitudes to government
* Living with people in the present

We drove the entire ring road and Snæfellness. I feel like we saw so much on this trip but at the same time I feel there’s SO much I missed and didn’t have time to do, which means future trip to Iceland for sure! Some highlight photos and itinerary below.

**Day 9: return home**

**What to bring**: definitely bring fleece, puffy coat, waterproof rain coat, warm gloves, winter hat (beanie), waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain pants, waterproof backpack cover, hiking pants (stretchy type) for comfort, sunglasses, sunscreen, bathing suit, flip flops, towel (or rent one for 7€ from car rental place), insect bite cream (or hydrocortisone) for biting midges, reusable water bottle, 240V European plug adapter (F type), phone case with wrist leash (so you don’t drop your phone over a cliff or into a waterfall taking a selfie). Phone roaming plan with data for GPS (reception is amazing all over even in remote areas). Music playlists (Icelandic artists), because music on radio cuts out in remote areas. Load up on snacks at Bonus / Kronan for the road. Food is famously expensive in restaurants. 

**Don’t bring:** cash, not needed anywhere. Just have a credit card that has a chip and pin, and make sure to call your credit card issuer before you leave to let them know you’re travelling so they don’t block your card. There’s no tipping in Iceland, and tax is always included in the price. 

**Also important when driving:**
- speed limit on paved highways is 90 kmh, fines are VERY high. 
- WATCH OUT for sheep. They are everywhere by the road, on the road. If you do hit one, you have to call the police (112)
- roads are very narrow, and shoulders are either non existent or steep drop off. So pay attention and don’t drift out of your lane!
- make sure your car insurance covers gravel. There’s gravel roads everywhere, even parts of Hwy 1 is under renovations in places.

Comment,,Adamantium-Aardvark,2024-06-23 09:51:38,"Yes and be careful, Google maps seems to always suggest you take road 939 between Raudhafell and Stefansbud around the mountain. And then the 95 from there to Eglisstadir. This is a rough dirt road that goes up into the mountains. I wouldn’t advise it if the weather is bad or the cloud ceiling is low. The ring road goes along the coast, it is paved, but takes about 40 mins longer. Again if the weather is bad best to take the slightly longer but safer route along hw1.  With a lunch stop you’re looking at a 6 hour drive between Höfn and Myvatn.  We’re glad we stopped in Egilsstadir. It’s a nice town and there’s some cool stuff around there (puffins, studlagil canyon, Gufu falls, Seydisfjodur, etc)

If the puffins are still around it’s worth the detour to Borgarfjardarhofn to see them. It’s 1 hour each way from Eglisstaðir.  They’re usually there until late August, so you might be cutting it close. Might be best to ask a week before going if anyone has been there to see them.",2,
Post,Ring Road Itinerary (July 2024),dushisellers,2024-06-22 15:29:49,"I would appreciate feedback on the following itinerary. By way of background, I'm in the US and my SO and I travel 2-3 times a year, at least once internationally. When we travel, we tend to ""go-go-go"" from one thing to the next -- we like to see and do, but not relax and take our time. We like to eat local food, but usually local street food that is cheaper/faster. I'm giving this context because we are planning to rent a car and do the ring road in 7 days, which I know from my research is often frowned upon on this sub (and rightfully so). We do plan to come back again someday (probably to see northern lights, among other things), so we are OK if we don't hit every single thing.

With that in mind, please let me know if you have any thoughts/concerns:

**Day 1 (Note, when we travel to Europe, we tend to start aligning our sleep with the new time zone, use melatonin, etc. and generally we do OK from a jetlag standpoint, but we will see).**

* Arrive at KEF at 7:00 and pick up rental car from Zero
* Depending on how we feel, stop by Kökulist bakery or Sigurjónsbakarí for some food
* Blue Lagoon reservation at 10:00 (although we are considering skipping this for Secret Lagoon, see below)
* Stop by Costco for some car snacks (and probably a hot dog)
* Thingvellir National Park (Almannagjá Trail, Öxarárfoss,  Langistigur, etc.), no more than 2-3 hours
* Kerið Crater
* If time, Reykjadalur Hot Spring Thermal River
* If we skipped Blue Lagoon, then we would fit in Secret Lagoon which is close to our guesthouse
* Dinner/go to guesthouse in Reykolt (the one in the Golden Circle, not the one north of Reykjavík) 

**Day 2**

* Complete the Golden Circle
* Lunch reservation at 11:30 at Friðheimar
* Hit as many waterfalls as we can between there and Vik (and skip the plane wreck)
* Try and see some puffins at Reynisfjara Beach (or should we do Dyrhólaey Viewpoint?)
* Stop at Bonus, if needed, and then explore Vik
* Dinner/guesthouse in Vik

**Day 3**

* If time, the Lava Show in Vik, but we will likely skip that since we will want to leave before it opens (perhaps we could fit it in the day before).
* Visit as many waterfalls and viewpoints as we can between Vik and Jökulsárlón/Diamond Beach, including Yoda Cave
* Long drive to guesthouse in Breiddalsvik (we plan to get in late) -- if not too tired, perhaps stopping at Vestrahorn

**Day 4 (these things are a bit far apart so I think there will already be a lot of driving this way, but if you think there is more in the area we should consider, let me know)**

* Drive through Egilsstadir (stop for food?)
* Hengifoss and Stuðlagil
* Guesthouse in Möðrudalur/Fjalladýrð

**Day 5**

* Dettifoss and Selfoss
* Hverir geothermal area 
* *Goðafoss*
* Whale watching tour from Hauganes (at 17:00)
* Guesthouse in Akureyri (but also considering a long drive that night to Hvammstangi so that we can get a head start on the next day, not sure which do to here)

**Day 6**

* Drive to Snæfellsnes Peninsula (either from Akureyri or Hvammstangi)
* See as much as we can on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula
* Guesthouse in Snæfellsbær

**Day 7**

* Drive to Reykjavík
* Spend a few hours exploring downtown Reykjavík
* If time, visit Laugardalslaug or Blue Lagoon (if we skipped it before)
* Hotel in Vogar
* Depending on how we feel, we might try to circle the Reykjanes peninsula (if the roads are accessible)
* We arrive at KEF at 7:30 on Day 8 to fly out

You'll notice that we'll probably miss some things on the south of the island; our thought there is that if we do come back, we will probably not do the ring road again, but instead focus more on on the area between Reykjavík and southern Iceland and (if in the summer) the highlands. 

There may still be some time to adjust which guesthouses we stay at for a couple of points, but we are going into this knowing that we will have some long drives (which are fine for us). That said, I would love any feedback you have -- we are REALLY excited.",6,7.0

Comment,,cold-november-rain,2024-06-21 14:12:49,"Eek! Thanks for the rumor! The Grimsey website boasts puffins as an attraction. 

There was a post just recently that said they were at the same spot you were and saw literally thousands(!!!) of them. I can't stop thinking about that! So amazing.",2,
Post,Lost puffin hat at Dettifoss (which has reopened!),TalcaParisLondres,2024-06-20 15:22:52,"Good news, the road to the parking lot on the west side of Dettifoss is open! We were able to easily park and take the trail down to the viewpoints. Some spots are still covered in snow but totally passable. It was an amazing experience, and I’m so glad that we went!

Bad news, my sweet mom thinks she dropped her wool puffin hat somewhere between the observation deck and the parking lot. Any chance one of you fellow travelers found it?

Safe travels, my friends! We are already planning a return trip!",0,0.0
