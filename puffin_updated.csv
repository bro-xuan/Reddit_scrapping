Post,Puffin Tour,MrPrettyKitty,2024-12-27 16:33:03,We’ll be revisiting lovely Iceland on a couple day stopover on the way to Denmark. We want to see puffins while we’re there June 12-June 15. Suggestions for a puffin tour? We’re close enough to the BSI terminal that we can walk. Thanks!,8,12.0
Comment,,World_travel777,2024-12-27 16:45:01,There is a tour at from Harbor that markets 100% sighting of puffins.  We went and did see them.  Google key words.  Idn remember the name of the company.   I do recommend booking in advance since you’re going during summer.,3,
Comment,,littlenurdle,2024-12-27 20:37:03,"In Reykjavik, I did the Puffin Express tour through Special Tours, they take you out to two puffin colony islands close to the city that has thousands of puffins and other seabirds on it during puffin season. It was absolutely worth it for the money, and the boat was relatively small and had maybe nine or ten people on it total.",5,

Comment,,Unknown,2024-12-27 17:46:15,"If you want a really neat experience, take the ferry to Flatey island. Spend the night. 
The puffins are on the island, and you get pretty darn close! Not to mention the history on that island is incredible!!!",3,
Comment,,Ehbak,2024-12-27 16:43:23,"I read here that during summer you can see them just behind lighthouses, not really needing a tour",2,

Comment,,MrPrettyKitty,2024-12-27 20:15:29,Are there tours/ferries/day trips that you know? We will be staying in Reykjavik.,1,
Comment,,EvidenceFar2289,2024-12-27 23:55:24,"Vestmannaeyjar is accessible by ferry about 30 minutes outside Selfoss so if you are not renting a car then I wouldn’t recommend it, instead I would book a tour that includes puffins and whales out of Reykjavik.",2,
Post,Puffin Festival,djslacker,2024-12-15 04:41:22,"Sooo, it isn’t hard to find the article titled ‘The Burning Man of Birding’, but I can’t find any solid dates on when the Iceland Puffin Festival actually is.  Can anyone help?",2,2.0
Comment,,MissKS84,2024-12-15 20:58:20,So as an Icelander I have never heard of a puffin festival there are some events around puffin but that's mostly helping pufflings to return to the ocean,1,
Post,Puffin photography spots in June,d0ughb0y1,2024-12-02 20:10:45,"Planning on an Iceland trip in June. Main objective is puffin and landscape photography.

Planning to go to Borgarfjörður Eystri. This does not travel through F road right? Planning to stay there one night.

Westman Island. Do you recommend day trip or ferry the car and stay a night on Westman Island?

Any other puffin sites good for photography?

I've read for some sites (Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg?), puffins are on a cliff and quite far, so thinking not ideal for photography.

Thanks",2,7.0
Comment,,puffin-net,2024-12-02 20:30:07,Reynisfjara (one of the black sand beaches on the south coast) has puffins nesting above the basalt columns. You would need a telephoto lens but you can get some amazing shots by standing next to the columns at low tide and pointing up at the birds in flight.,1,
Comment,,BionicGreek,2024-12-03 01:54:40,Best photos of puffins I was able to take were in the westfjords and on Grimsey to the north. Do an overnight up there. Book early though as there are limited lodgings,1,
Comment,,davis_away,2024-12-03 04:29:34,"I don't know if there are restrictions in place in June, but in early August I was able to get very close to the puffins at Dyrhólaey.",1,
Comment,,hertziceland,2024-12-03 09:15:50,"You're right about Borgarfjörður Eystri; it’s a great choice and doesn’t involve F roads, so you’ll have a smooth drive. Staying overnight is a good idea to catch those early morning and late evening shots when the light is just perfect.

For the Westman Islands, if you can spare the time, I'd recommend staying the night rather than just doing a day trip. It gives you more flexibility to explore and photograph the puffins and the stunning landscapes there without rushing. Plus, the sunset and sunrise are spectacular!

You mentioned Dyrhólaey and Látrabjarg; indeed, puffins can be a bit far on the cliffs which might challenge photography without a good zoom lens. If you're looking for other sites where the puffins might be easier to photograph, consider places like Akurey, Stórhöfði in Vestmannaeyjar, and Tjörnes Peninsula near Húsavík for some fantastic opportunities.

Comment,,d0ughb0y1,2024-12-02 20:42:39,"Thanks. I'll add that to my list.  
I just saw on YT video  Hafnarholmi at Borgarfjordur Eystri even has a bird blind for photographing the puffins.",1,
Comment,,hydrangeapurple,2024-12-02 21:51:33,">Borgarfjordur Eystri

This is the place where you can photograph them in very close proximity. There are plenty of them. Some are so near that you can even touch them (although you absolutely should not!). You don't need to drive through any F-roads to get there. But you would need to drive into some higher grounds so you'll just need to drive carefully and slow down as necessary.",2,

Is this a seasonal thing?  My gf was a little bummed we didn't get to see it up close.",3,4.0

Comment,,ukudancer,2024-09-09 14:44:18,"This is heading to the Westman Islands ferry...I was keeping an eye out in this area and it was also gone by Saturday.  

I appreciate you looking into it.  

I honestly think it was a seasonal thing to promote folks to take the ferry to see the Puffin colony.  I'm guessing it'll be back for next year's puffin season.",1,
